Webhook also supports batching and a powerful templating feature designed to handle complex and dynamic data formats.</p><p>There are three Webhook connectors to choose from based on the authorization requirements of your vendor, as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Webhook</strong> (BasicAuth) – For services that do not require authentication or only require basic authentication with a username and password.</li><li><strong>Webhook OAuth2</strong> (3-Legged) – Requires the user to login to the service to obtain an access token.</li><li><strong>Webhook OAuth2</strong> (2-Legged) – Does not require the user to login to the service. The webhook is configured with the information required to authenticate.</li></ul><p>Webhook OAuth2 is used for services that explicitly require OAuth 2.0 authentication.</p><p>To get started, go to the connector marketplace and add the Webhook instance you wish to use.

            "body":"<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2><p>A connector is an integration that transmits data between Tealium and another vendor in real-time. A connector offers actions that represent vendor-supported APIs. An action is triggered in real-time by an incoming event from a feed or a visitor joining or leaving an audience. An action sends data based on mappings that associate Tealium attributes to the expected vendor parameters.</p><h3 id=\"terminology\">Terminology</h3><ul><li><strong>Connector</strong><br>A connector represents the connection to your vendor account. This is configured using credentials such as an account ID, username and password, or an API key.</li><li><strong>Action</strong><br>An action is a vendor operation, such as triggering an email, building a custom audience, or managing leads. Actions vary depending on the vendor service. Multiple actions can be associated with a single connector.</li><li><strong>Frequency Cap</strong><br>A connector action performs in real-time, but some actions are designed to have a wait period before they are triggered. The frequency cap allows you to set a downtime period for actions so that they do not trigger immediately. <a href=\"/server-side/connectors/frequency-capping/about/\">Learn more about Frequency Capping and Prioritization</a></li><li><strong>Source</strong><br>Source indicates the origin of the data being acted upon. A source can be an audience or an event feed.</li></ul><h3 id=\"consent-categories\">Consent categories</h3><p>Each connector in the marketplace has one or more consent categories assigned for each available action. To view the consent category for a specific connector, click the Information icon next to the connector action.</p><figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/server-side/eventstream-connector-consent-categories.png\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/server-side/eventstream-connector-consent-categories.png\"         alt=\"EventStream Connector Consent Categories\"         title=\"EventStream Connector Consent Categories\"/>    </a></figure><p>AudienceStream is categorized in the <strong>CDP</strong> consent category and DataAccess is categorized in the <strong>Big Data</strong> consent category. For additional information about server-side consent, see <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/consent-management/consent-preferences-dialog/manage/\">Consent Preferences Manager</a>.</p><h3 id=\"retries\">Retries</h3><p>If a connector action fails, it is retried three times at 1 minute, 5 minute, and 30 minute intervals. If the request is successful on any of the subsequent retry attempts, the request is reported as a success in the UI. If all three retries fail, the request is dropped and reported as an error in the UI.</p><p>A retry is attempted when any of the following error codes occur:</p><ul><li>408 – Forbidden</li><li>429 – Too Many Requests</li><li>500 – Internal Server Error</li><li>502 – Bad Gateway</li><li>503 – Service Unavailable</li><li>504 – Gateway Timeout</li></ul><p>A retry is not attempted when a <strong>Response Timeout - Vendor API did not respond within 5000 milliseconds</strong> response is received. The request payload was sent, but the vendor did not send a response within our allowed time of 5 seconds. The request may have succeeded on the vendor&rsquo;s side, but because it took longer than 5 seconds to get a response, we treat it as a failure.</p><h3 id=\"overload-protection\">Overload protection</h3><p>Connectors perform actions through multiple instances of a data handler. Sometimes, data handlers encounter transmission errors with vendors. If errors exceed a configured threshold, Tealium can pause or throttle data transmission to vendors until the error rate drops.</p><p>For example, if the overall rate of failure for an instance exceeds 40% per 100 attempts, that instance will pause processing actions for 1 minute. The instance then attempts to process half of the actions in the queue. If the failure rate for these 50 attempts remains above 20%, the instance pauses for another 60 seconds before trying again. Otherwise, the instance resumes full operation.</p><p>Tealium activates and adjusts the thresholds at the various levels as needed to ensure maximum success and performance for customers.</p><h3 id=\"restricted-data\">Restricted data</h3><p>Restricted data settings do not apply to connectors. Attributes marked as restricted data are always included, whether you are sending them through mappings or as part of the visitor profile. This cannot be changed. Learn more about <a href=\"/server-side/attributes/restricted-data/\">Restricted Data</a>.</p><h3 id=\"ip-whitelists\">IP whitelists</h3><p>If a connector you use has strict rules about which systems it accepts requests from, you can whitelist the IP addresses of the Customer Data Hub. The IP addresses that make connector requests can be found in the <a href=\"/server-side/administration/ip-allow-list/\">IP Addresses for Customer Data Hub</a>.</p><h2 id=\"screen-navigation\">Screen navigation</h2><h3 id=\"overview-screen\">Overview screen</h3><p>The connector overview screen summary displays the following metrics as columns:</p><ul><li><strong>Total</strong><br>Total actions triggered.

Deprecation typically occurs when a connector or an action has been replaced with a newer version or a new connector or action that should be used instead.</p><p>There are two types of deprecation, as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Functional Deprecation</strong> – The connector or action is deprecated, and may be removed in the future, but is still working.</li><li><strong>Full Deprecation</strong> – The connector or action is deprecated and no longer works. Actions for a fully deprecated connector are not executed.</li></ul><p>When a connector or an action is deprecated, an icon is shown next to the connector or action in the connector list. When you hover over the icon, a message is displayed that specifies whether the deprecated connector or action still works.</p><figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/server-side/deprecatedconnector.png\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/server-side/deprecatedconnector.png\"         alt=\"Deprecated Connector\"         title=\"Deprecated Connector\"/>    </a></figure><h3 id=\"reporting-chart-for-actions\">Reporting chart for actions</h3><p>The following sections describe how to view the reporting chart, view error details, and download error reports.</p><figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/server-side/connector-reporting-graph-overview.png\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/server-side/connector-reporting-graph-overview.png\"         alt=\"Connector Reporting Graph Overview\"         title=\"Connector Reporting Graph Overview\"/>    </a></figure><h4 id=\"view-the-chart\">View the chart</h4><p>When you click on a connector action, the chart displays the number of times the action executed each day.

            "body":"<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2><p>A delayed action is an AudienceStream connector action that is delayed based on a set of conditions or time criteria. A delayed action can be configured for an AudienceStream connector when the trigger is set to <strong>In Audience at the end of visit</strong>, as shown in the following example:</p><figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/server-side/001.png\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/server-side/001.png\"         alt=\"Connector actions\"         title=\"Connector actions\"/>    </a></figure><p>A delay can be scheduled for an action for a specific number of hours or days and is scheduled only if the visitor is in the audience at the end of current visit.

For more information, see <a href=\"#changes-to-a-connector-after-delayed-actions-are-scheduled\">Changing a connector after delayed actions are scheduled</a>.</p><h3 id=\"supported-attribute-types\">Supported attribute types</h3><p>Delayed actions only work on audiences with conditions that use visitor-scoped attributes and can send only visitor attribute data. Visit attributes are not supported because the data stored in these attributes only persists for the length of the visit.</p><p>In addition, the audience that triggers the delayed action should not use visit attributes. When the visitor profile is re-evaluated at activation time, and the audience uses visit attributes, the visitor may no longer be in the audience.</p><p class=\"note\"><i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-triangle\"></i>No error or warning is generated if you configure a delayed action for an audience that uses visit attributes.</p><h2 id=\"delay-an-action-for-hours-or-days\">Delay an action for hours or days</h2><p>To delay an action for a specific number of hours or days, use the <strong>DELAY Action for 1 Days</strong> option. If a visitor is in the audience when the visit ends, a delayed action is scheduled for the specified time period. In the following example, the action would be scheduled for the following day if the visitor is in the audience.</p><figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/server-side/002.png\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/server-side/002.png\"         alt=\"delayed action scheduled\"         title=\"delayed action scheduled\"/>    </a></figure><p>If the visitor returns for a second visit 12 hours after the first visit ended AND the visitor meets the condition <strong>In Audience at end of visit</strong> when the second visit ends, then the original delayed action will be rescheduled to 1 day (24 hours) after the second visit ends. In other words, the delayed action is now scheduled to 36 hours after the first visit ends.</p><p>The maximum allowed delay for an action is 365 days or 8760 hours. The number of days or hours must be a whole number, decimal values such as <code>1.5</code> or <code>0.75</code> are not allowed. The smallest delay that can be configured is 1 hour.</p><h2 id=\"delay-an-action-only-if-the-visitor-joined-the-audience-during-the-current-visit\">Delay an action only if the visitor joined the audience during the current visit</h2><p>The <strong>In Audience at the end of visit</strong> condition is easily met, and may include visitors that were in the audience at the start of the visit. The <strong>AND was not a member of this Audience at start of visit</strong> option can be used to schedule a delayed action only if the visitor is in the audience at the end of the visit AND the visitor joined the audience during this visit.</p><figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/server-side/003.png\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/server-side/003.png\"         alt=\"additional when option\"         title=\"additional when option\"/>    </a></figure><h2 id=\"changing-a-connector-after-delayed-actions-are-scheduled\">Changing a connector after delayed actions are scheduled</h2><p>A connector or an action could be changed between the scheduling time and the activation time. How the changes affect a delayed action depends on what was changed, as follows:</p><ul><li>The values of visitor attributes have changed.<br>The attribute values at activation time are used in the connector action.</li><li>The audience criteria for the audience associated with the connector action was changed.<br>The visitor profile is reevaluated at activation time to see if it remains in the audience. If the visitor does not meet the current audience conditions, the action is not triggered.</li><li>The connector action was changed to use a different audience.<br>The connector action is not triggered. The audience ID for the connector action must be the same at scheduling time and activation time.</li><li>The delay period was changed.<br>This does not have any effect on already scheduled delayed actions.</li><li>The connector action was deactivated.<br>This does not affect already scheduled delayed actions. They will still trigger. Deactivating a delayed connector action only prevents new delayed actions from being scheduled.</li><li>The connector action was deleted.<br>Scheduled delayed actions will not trigger because their configuration cannot be retrieved.</li><li>The connector action was changed in some other way (for example, the attributes mapped have been changed).<br>The connector configuration at activation time (not scheduling time) is used.</li></ul>"
