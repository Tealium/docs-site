            "body": "<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n<p>A connector is an integration that transmits data between Tealium and another vendor in real-time. A connector offers actions that represent vendor-supported APIs. An action is triggered in real-time by an incoming event from a feed or a visitor joining or leaving an audience. An action sends data based on mappings that associate Tealium attributes to the expected vendor parameters.</p>\n<p>In CloudStream, segment data is not persisted or stored in Tealium systems. After retrieving the data and sending it to configured connectors, Tealium discards it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"terminology\">Terminology</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Connector</strong><br>\nA connector represents the connection to your vendor account. The connection is configured using credentials such as an account ID, username and password, or an API key.</li>\n<li><strong>Action</strong><br>\nAn action is a vendor operation, such as triggering an email, building a custom audience, or managing leads. Actions vary depending on the vendor service. Multiple actions can be associated with a single connector.</li>\n<li><strong>Frequency Cap</strong><br>\nA connector action performs in real-time, but some actions are designed to have a wait period before they are triggered. The frequency cap lets you set a downtime period for actions so that they do not trigger immediately. For more information, see <a href=\"/server-side/connectors/frequency-capping/about/\">Action frequency capping and prioritization</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Source</strong><br>\nSource indicates the origin of the data being acted upon. A source can be an audience or an event feed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"consent-categories\">Consent categories</h3>\n<p>Each connector in the marketplace has one or more consent categories assigned for each available action. The consent information for a connector action is shown on the <strong>Action Details</strong> screen, under <strong>Additional Details</strong>.</p>\n<figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/server-side/eventstream-connector-consent-categories.png\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/server-side/eventstream-connector-consent-categories.png\"\n         alt=\"EventStream Connector Consent Categories\"\n         title=\"EventStream Connector Consent Categories\"/>\n    </a>\n</figure>\n<p>AudienceStream is categorized in the <strong>CDP</strong> consent category and DataAccess is categorized in the <strong>Big Data</strong> consent category. For additional information about server-side consent, see <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/consent-management/consent-preferences-dialog/manage/\">Consent Preferences Manager</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"retries\">Retries</h3>\n<p>If a connector action fails, it is retried three times at 1-minute, 5-minute, and 30-minute intervals. If the request is successful on any of the subsequent retry attempts, the request is reported as a success in the UI. If all three retries fail, the request is dropped and reported as an error in the UI.</p>\n<p>A retry is attempted when any of the following error codes occur:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>408 – Forbidden</li>\n<li>429 – Too Many Requests</li>\n<li>500 – Internal Server Error</li>\n<li>502 – Bad Gateway</li>\n<li>503 – Service Unavailable</li>\n<li>504 – Gateway Timeout</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A retry is not attempted when a <strong>Response Timeout - Vendor API did not respond within 5000 milliseconds</strong> response is received. The request payload was sent, but the vendor did not send a response within our allowed time of five seconds. The request may have succeeded on the vendor&rsquo;s side, but because it took longer than five seconds to get a response, we treat it as a failure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"overload-protection\">Overload protection</h3>\n<p>Connectors perform actions through multiple instances of a data handler. Sometimes, data handlers encounter transmission errors with vendors. If errors exceed a configured threshold, Tealium can pause or throttle data transmission to vendors until the error rate drops.</p>\n<p>For example, if the overall rate of failure for an instance exceeds 40% per 100 attempts, that instance pauses processing actions for 1 minute. The instance then attempts to process half of the actions in the queue. If the failure rate for these 50 attempts remains above 20%, the instance pauses for another 60 seconds before trying again. Otherwise, the instance resumes full operation.</p>\n<p>Tealium activates and adjusts the thresholds at the various levels as needed to ensure maximum success and performance for customers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"restricted-data\">Restricted data</h3>\n<p>Restricted data settings do not apply to connectors. Attributes marked as restricted data are always included, whether you are sending them through mappings or as part of the visitor profile. This cannot be changed. Learn more about <a href=\"/server-side/attributes/restricted-data/\">Restricted Data</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ip-allow-lists\">IP allow lists</h3>\n<p>If a connector you use has strict rules about which systems it accepts requests from, you can add the IP addresses of the Customer Data Hub to your allow list. The IP addresses that make connector requests can be found in the <a href=\"/server-side/administration/ip-allow-list/\">IP Addresses for Customer Data Hub</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"visitor-identity-synchronization\">Visitor identity synchronization</h3>\n<p>To improve visitor identity matching between Tealium and third-party vendors, use a cookie matching tag. A cookie matching tag synchronizes visitor identifiers between Tealium and the vendor. It requests a third-party identifier, receives an anonymous ID, and saves it in a cookie. This enables more accurate tracking and enriched data for connector actions. For more information, see <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/tags/cookie-matching/\">About persistent cookie matching</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"screen-navigation\">Screen navigation</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview-screen\">Overview screen</h3>\n<p>The connectors overview screen displays the following data about each connector:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Actions</strong><br>\nThe number of connector actions configured for each data type (event and visitor). Click the information (i) icon to display the timeline for the total in this column.</li>\n<li><strong>Total Volume</strong><br>\nThe number of actions triggered for the connector.</li>\n<li><strong>Success</strong><br>\nThe number of action successes.</li>\n<li><strong>Error</strong><br>\nThe number of action errors.</li>\n<li><strong>Date Modified</strong><br>\nThe date the connector was last modified.</li>\n<li><strong>Labels</strong><br>\nThe labels applied to the connector.</li>\n<li><strong>Status</strong><br>\nThe connector status, which can be <strong>Active</strong>, <strong>Inactive</strong>, or <strong>Deprecated</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Export metrics (total volume, successes, errors, and retries) for all connectors by clicking <strong>Export Metrics</strong>.

Deprecation typically occurs when a connector or an action has been replaced with a newer version or a new connector or action that should be used instead.</p>\n<p>There are two types of deprecation, as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Functional Deprecation</strong> – The connector or action is deprecated, and may be removed in the future, but is still working.</li>\n<li><strong>Full Deprecation</strong> – The connector or action is deprecated and no longer works. Actions for a fully deprecated connector are not executed.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/server-side/connectors/deprecated-status.png\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/server-side/connectors/deprecated-status.png\"/>\n    </a>\n</figure>\n"

Webhook also supports batching. Additionally, it includes a powerful templating feature designed to handle complex and dynamic data formats.</p>\n<p>There are four Webhook connectors to choose from based on the authorization requirements of your vendor, as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Webhook (BasicAuth)</strong>: For services that do not require authentication or only require basic authentication with a username and password.</li>\n<li><strong>Webhook (OAuth2 - 3-Legged)</strong>: Requires the user to log in to the service to obtain an access token.</li>\n<li><strong>Webhook (OAuth2 - 2-Legged)</strong>: Does not require the user to log in to the service. The webhook is configured with the information required to authenticate.</li>\n<li><strong>Webhook (JWT)</strong>: Uses JSON web token authentication. Does not require the user to log in to the service. The webhook is configured with the information required to authenticate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Webhook OAuth2 is used for services that explicitly require OAuth 2.0 authentication.</p>\n<p>To get started, go to the connector marketplace and add the Webhook instance you want to use.

For that reason, the Webhook connector does not track cookie-based sessions and effectively ignores <code>Set-Cookie</code> header values in HTTP responses.</p>\n"

            "title": "Delayed actions",
            "body": "<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n<p>A delayed action is an AudienceStream connector action that is delayed based on a set of conditions or time criteria. A delayed action can be configured for an AudienceStream connector when the trigger is set to <strong>In Audience at the end of visit</strong>, as shown in the following example:</p>\n<figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/server-side/001.png\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/server-side/001.png\"\n         alt=\"Connector actions\"\n         title=\"Connector actions\"/>\n    </a>\n</figure>\n<p>A delay can be scheduled for an action for a specific number of hours or days and is scheduled only if the visitor is in the audience at the end of current visit. The delayed action is triggered only if the visitor is still in the audience at the scheduled activation time.</p>\n<p>If a visitor returns for a second visit after a delayed action has been triggered, and the visitor meets the condition <strong>In Audience at the end of visit</strong> when the second visit ends, then a new delayed action is scheduled.</p>\n<p>This article uses the following terms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Scheduling time</strong> - The time at the end of a visit when connector actions are scheduled for delayed activation.</li>\n<li><strong>Activation time</strong> - The time after the delay when connector actions are triggered.</li>\n<li><strong>In Audience at end of visit</strong> - The visitor is in the selected audience when the visit ends.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The end of a visit is determined by user inactivity. For more information, see <a href=\"/server-side/attributes/session-length/\">Session length</a>.</p>\n<p>Delayed actions can only be scheduled for activated connectors. To learn more about audience connectors and the trigger setting, see <a href=\"/server-side/connectors/add/#select-a-source-for-audiencestream\">Add a Connector</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-delayed-actions-are-scheduled-and-processed\">How delayed actions are scheduled and processed</h3>\n<p>Scheduled actions are checked at regular intervals to determine which of the scheduled actions have expired and are ready to be triggered, as shown in the following figure:\n<figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/server-side/connectors-process-delayed-action-flow.png\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/server-side/connectors-process-delayed-action-flow.png\"\n         alt=\"flow diagram showing the steps for processing delayed actions\"\n         title=\"flow diagram showing the steps for processing delayed actions\"/>\n    </a>\n</figure></p>\n<p>The activation time (the time at which the action is triggered) is based on the time delay you specify.</p>\n<p>At activation time, the visitor profile is evaluated again to verify that the visitor is still in the audience. If the visitor is in the audience and the action frequency has not been capped, the delayed action is triggered.</p>\n<p class=\"note\"><i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-triangle\"></i>If the connector or action is changed between the scheduling time and the activation time, the changes could prevent triggering the action. For more information, see <a href=\"#changes-to-a-connector-after-delayed-actions-are-scheduled\">Changing a connector after delayed actions are scheduled</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"supported-attribute-types\">Supported attribute types</h3>\n<p>Delayed actions only work on audiences with conditions that use visitor-scoped attributes and can send only visitor attribute data. Visit attributes are not supported because the data stored in these attributes only persists for the length of the visit.</p>\n<p>In addition, the audience that triggers the delayed action should not use visit attributes. When the visitor profile is re-evaluated at activation time, and the audience uses visit attributes, the visitor may no longer be in the audience.</p>\n<p class=\"note\"><i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-triangle\"></i>No error or warning is generated if you configure a delayed action for an audience that uses visit attributes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"delay-an-action-for-hours-or-days\">Delay an action for hours or days</h2>\n<p>To delay an action for a specific number of hours or days, use the <strong>DELAY Action for 1 Days</strong> option. If a visitor is in the audience when the visit ends, a delayed action is scheduled for the specified time period. In the following example, the action would be scheduled for the following day if the visitor is in the audience.</p>\n<figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/server-side/002.png\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/server-side/002.png\"\n         alt=\"delayed action scheduled\"\n         title=\"delayed action scheduled\"/>\n    </a>\n</figure>\n<p>If the visitor returns for a second visit 12 hours after the first visit ended AND the visitor meets the condition <strong>In Audience at end of visit</strong> when the second visit ends, then the original delayed action will be rescheduled to 1 day (24 hours) after the second visit ends. In other words, the delayed action is now scheduled to 36 hours after the first visit ends.</p>\n<p>The maximum allowed delay for an action is 365 days or 8760 hours. The number of days or hours must be a whole number, decimal values such as <code>1.5</code> or <code>0.75</code> are not allowed. The smallest delay that can be configured is 1 hour.</p>\n<h2 id=\"delay-an-action-only-if-the-visitor-joined-the-audience-during-the-current-visit\">Delay an action only if the visitor joined the audience during the current visit</h2>\n<p>The <strong>In Audience at the end of visit</strong> condition is easily met, and may include visitors that were in the audience at the start of the visit. The <strong>AND was not a member of this Audience at start of visit</strong> option can be used to schedule a delayed action only if the visitor is in the audience at the end of the visit AND the visitor joined the audience during this visit.</p>\n<figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/server-side/003.png\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/server-side/003.png\"\n         alt=\"additional when option\"\n         title=\"additional when option\"/>\n    </a>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"changing-a-connector-after-delayed-actions-are-scheduled\">Changing a connector after delayed actions are scheduled</h2>\n<p>A connector or an action could be changed between the scheduling time and the activation time. How the changes affect a delayed action depends on what was changed, as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The values of visitor attributes have changed.<br>\nThe attribute values at activation time are used in the connector action.</li>\n<li>The audience criteria for the audience associated with the connector action was changed.<br>\nThe visitor profile is reevaluated at activation time to see if it remains in the audience. If the visitor does not meet the current audience conditions, the action is not triggered.</li>\n<li>The connector action was changed to use a different audience.<br>\nThe connector action is not triggered. The audience ID for the connector action must be the same at scheduling time and activation time.</li>\n<li>The delay period was changed.<br>\nThis does not have any effect on already scheduled delayed actions.</li>\n<li>The connector action was deactivated.<br>\nThis does not affect already scheduled delayed actions. They will still trigger. Deactivating a delayed connector action only prevents new delayed actions from being scheduled.</li>\n<li>The connector action was deleted.<br>\nScheduled delayed actions will not trigger because their configuration cannot be retrieved.</li>\n<li>The connector action was changed in some other way (for example, the attributes mapped have been changed).<br>\nThe connector configuration at activation time (not scheduling time) is used.</li>\n</ul>\n"
