Users in a group inherit those permissions for the associated profiles, which simplifies managing permissions for a large number of users and profiles.</p><p class=\"tip\"><i class=\"fa fa-info-circle\"></i>Client-side profiles are separate from server-side profiles, but a single permission group can grant access to both.</p><p>An <a href=\"/administration/admin-roles/\"><em>admin role</em></a> grants access to features and settings that affect the entire account. A user with an admin role receives those permissions regardless of their permission group membership, which makes it easier for you to delegate management of your account to specific users. Users without admin roles receive only the access to the account they obtain through their membership in permission groups.</p><h3 id=\"new-user-activation\">New user activation</h3><p>When you invite users to your account, they receive an email to activate their account. After a user activates their account, add them to a permission group with the appropriate profile and product feature access. You can add a user to multiple permission groups to grant the user greater access to the profiles, such as publishing rights.</p><h3 id=\"dynamic-user-interface\">Dynamic user interface</h3><p>The interface changes based on the user&rsquo;s permissions:</p><ul><li>If a user does not have access to a product, that product does not appear in the navigation.</li><li>If a user has access to some features, but not others, they see only the features they can access in the navigation.</li><li>If a user does not have edit permission for a feature, the <strong>Edit</strong> button does not appear on pages for that feature.</li></ul><h2 id=\"setup-plan\">Setup plan</h2><p>The method you use to set up your account, users, and permissions structure will differ depending on your organization&rsquo;s size and complexity.</p><p>The following steps list one possible strategy to organize the initial access to your account:</p><ol><li>Determine the users and teams that will need access to your Tealium account.</li><li>Organize the users into groups based on their job responsibilities and the access they need for your account&rsquo;s profiles and Tealium features.</li><li>Create <a href=\"/administration/permission-groups/\">permission groups</a> with the necessary access to profiles and features based on the groups you came up with in Step 2.</li><li>Add <a href=\"/administration/users/\">users</a> to your account.</li><li>Assign those users to the permission groups you created in Step 3.</li><li>Assign user permissions and <a href=\"/administration/admin-roles/\">admin roles</a> to users in your account to delegate management of users, features, products, and Personally Identifiable Information (PII).</li></ol><p>As you progress through your plan, you may identify the need for more profiles and permission groups to access those profiles.</p><p>For help with migrating your existing settings to the platform permissions system, see <a href=\"/administration/permissions-system-migration-guide/\">Permissions System Migration Guide</a>.</p><h3 id=\"publish-permissions\">Publish permissions</h3><p>Users in a permission group with server-side publish permissions automatically receive full access to all server-side products and features.</p><p>For example, if User X is a member of Permission Group Y and Permission Group Y has server-side publishing access, User X will have full access on every server-side product and feature.</p><h2 id=\"access-the-manage-permissions-screen\">Access the Manage Permissions screen</h2><p class=\"tip\"><i class=\"fa fa-info-circle\"></i>Only users with the account admin or user admin roles can access this screen.

Users in a permission group with server-side publish permissions automatically receive full access to all server-side products and features.</p><p class=\"note\"><i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-triangle\"></i>Granting publish permissions to a group may result in users receiving greater permissions on products and features than you intend to give them. For example, an AudienceStream-only developer that you grant publishing rights to will receive with full permissions on a profile, which would include EventStream, DataAccess, and every other server-side product and feature.<br><br>To avoid granting users greater permissions than necessary, we  recommend that you create a separate permission group with publishing permissions for each of your server-side profiles.</p><p>For more information, see <a href=\"/administration/about-permissions/\">About platform permissions</a>.</p><h3 id=\"product-features\">Product features</h3><p>Product access is divided into feature permissions.</p><p>For example, access to AudienceStream is divided into the following feature permissions:</p><ul><li>Dashboard</li><li>Discovery/Sizing</li><li>Audiences</li><li>Audience Connectors</li><li>Visitor/Visit Attributes</li></ul><h4 id=\"permissions-to-features-in-multiple-products\">Permissions to features in multiple products</h4><p>Carefully consider when you set a user to <strong>No Access</strong> for a feature or product. If you disable feature access for a user, that user cannot access the feature or any other features that depend on it. For example:</p><ul><li>If you set a user to <strong>No Access</strong> for AudienceStream, that user cannot select an audience to action in an AudienceStream connector.</li><li>If you set a user to <strong>No Access</strong> for server-side labels, the user does not see labels on the server-side. They can still access connectors or other features with labels on them, but they cannot see or edit the labels themselves.</li><li>AudienceStream and EventStream share several features, such as rules and labels. For example, if a user only has permissions for AudienceStream and they edit a rule in AudienceStream that is shared between AudienceStream and EventStream, the rule will change in EventStream, too.</li></ul><h4 id=\"tealium-insights-permissions\">Tealium Insights permissions</h4><p>Insights user roles are managed through the <strong>Insights &gt; Manage Users</strong> page. However, Insights users must also be a member of a permission group with view access to the Insights feature.</p><p>For more information, see <a href=\"/server-side/insights/about/#author-and-reader-roles\">About Tealium Insights</a>.</p><h3 id=\"publishing-permissions\">Publishing permissions</h3><p>Permission groups also manage publishing permissions on the client-side and server-side.</p><ul><li>On the client-side, set publishing rights with the <strong>Publish to Dev/Custom</strong>, <strong>Publish to QA</strong>, and <strong>Publish to Prod</strong> feature permissions.</li><li>On the server-side, set publishing rights on the <strong>Group Permissions</strong> tab of the permission group.</li></ul><p>Permission groups have publishing rights on the profiles to which you give them access.</p><p>Remember, a permission group can also be granted publishing rights for server-side profiles. Users who are members of a permission group with server-side publishing rights have full access to all server-side products and features.</p><!-- #### Publishing changes to features in multiple productsIf you disable a product for a user, but the user has server-side publish permission and access to another product that shares features with the first product, the user can still publish changes to those shared features. For example, EventStream and AudienceStream share some features, such as rules and labels.If a user has publish permission and only has access to EventStream, they can publish changes made to rules and labels in EventStream, and those changes also affect AudienceStream. Similarly, if a user has publish permission and only has access to AudienceStream, their published changes to rules and labels also affect EventStream. --><h3 id=\"users-in-multiple-permission-groups\">Users in multiple permission groups</h3><p>Access rights to profiles are cumulative. The user always receives the highest level of access granted by their permission groups, even if the permission groups have conflicting permissions.</p><p>For example, Group A has <strong>View</strong> permissions on a profile, while Group B has <strong>View &amp; Edit</strong> permissions on that profile. A user in both Group A and Group B has <strong>View &amp; Edit</strong> permissions on that profile.</p><p class=\"note\"><i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-triangle\"></i>A user with the profile admin role has full permission on all profiles in the account.</p><h2 id=\"manage-permission-groups\">Manage permission groups</h2><p>To manage permission groups, in the admin menu, click <strong>Manage Permissions</strong>.
