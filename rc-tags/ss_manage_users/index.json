            "body":"<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2><p>Server-side user permissions provide control over the degree of access users have for each profile by creating a separation of access between the Tealium client-side interface and the server-side interface. From the server-side <strong>Manage Users</strong> screen, you can do the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Grant Access to New Users</strong><br>New users are added to accounts in Tealium iQ Tag Management. After new users are added, the new users appear in the server-side user permissions list where server-side access can be granted, by profile. To add new users to an account, you must have the <strong>Manage Users</strong> permission. To assign roles on the server-side, you you must have the <strong>Manage Account</strong> permission.</li><li><strong>Specify Access</strong><br>Account administrators can grant access to users only for the areas that they intend to work on. They can also grant Save and Publish permissions for client-side products for a profile that do not carry over to server-side products for that profile.</li><li><strong>Set Permissions for Future Profiles</strong><br>For active profiles, you can set the permissions for future profiles, which allows user admins to define a profile-level permission role for users of new profiles created for an account.</li><li><strong>Add and Edit Bulk Users</strong><br>You can add and edit users in bulk (up to 25 users at a time) and search user profiles and filter users by permission type.</li></ul><h2 id=\"admin-users\">Admin users</h2><p>Admins of the server-side interface are the only users that have the ability to change the permissions of server-side users. None of the server-side permission roles grant this ability.</p><p class=\"tip\"><i class=\"fa fa-info-circle\"></i>To be an admin on the server-side, you must have the <strong>Manage Account</strong> permission in the client-side interface.</p><p>Only the <strong>Manage Users</strong> permission on the client-side grants the ability to add users to the account. To learn more about managing user permission in Tealium iQ Tag Management, see <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/administration/user-permissions/about/\">Managing User Permissions in iQ Tag Management</a>.</p><h2 id=\"server-side-permission-roles\">Server-side permission roles</h2><p>Server-side access is controlled using predefined permission roles. For each profile in the account, users are assigned a permission role to determine their access level.</p><p>The following table describes the four available server-side permission roles:</p><table><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">PERMISSION ROLE</th><th style=\"text-align:left\">DESCRIPTION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>No Access (default)</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:left\"><ul><li>This is the default role for all users other than account administrators.</li><li>The <strong>No Access</strong> permission role does not grant any access to the server-side profile.</li><li>If the user attempts to access the server-side, their profile is blocked and an <strong>Access Denied</strong> message appears.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Reader</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:left\"><ul><li>The <strong>Reader</strong> permission grants read-only access to the server-side profile.</li><li>A user in this role can browse the profile configuration, but <strong>Save/Publish</strong> is disabled. Users with this role cannot save any changes.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Editor</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:left\"><ul><li>The <strong>Editor</strong> permission grants edit and save access to the server-side profile.</li><li>With this role, you can save but not publish.</li><li>Users with this role can also access and edit settings from the <strong>Profile Admin &gt; Settings</strong> menu.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Publisher<br> (Admin default)</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:left\"><ul><li>This is the default role for account administrators.</li><li>The <strong>Publisher</strong> permission grants the same access as the <strong>Editor</strong> role, with the addition of the ability to save and publish the profile.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Profile access between the server-side and client-side product is mutually exclusive. For example, you can grant Save and Publish permissions for client-side products without impacting server-side product permissions for a given profile. In addition, if you remove or change user access to a profile on the client-side, it is not removed or changed on the server-side.</p>"
