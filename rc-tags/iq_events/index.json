When a visitor performs the action, a tracking call is triggered that includes the event listener variables.</p>\n<p>With no-code event listeners, you can do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Configure an event listener for your own unique needs.</li>\n<li>Select from various scopes that determine when the event listener loads on the page.</li>\n<li>Set up advanced rule logic to determine which pages load the event listeners.</li>\n<li>Set unique Event Triggers that you can configure based on your tracking needs.</li>\n<li>Target specific elements on the page with event listeners.</li>\n<li>Configure a data payload to be sent when the action takes place.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"event-types-and-variables\">Event types and variables</h2>\n<p>The following types of events are available through this feature:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/event-types/click-event/\"><strong>Click</strong></a> - When a visitor clicks their mouse on a page.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/event-types/mouseover-event/\"><strong>Mouseover</strong></a> - When a visitor hovers their mouse over a specific element on a page.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/event-types/form-submission-event/\"><strong>Form Submission</strong></a> - When a visitor submits a form on a page.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/event-types/youtube-event/\"><strong>YouTube</strong></a> - When a visitor interacts with an embedded YouTube video on a page.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/event-types/vimeo-event/\"><strong>Vimeo</strong></a> - When a visitor interacts with an embedded Vimeo video on a page.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/event-types/html5-video-event/\"><strong>HTML5 Video</strong></a> - When a visitor interacts with an embedded HTML5 video on a page.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/event-types/page-load-event/\"><strong>Page Load</strong></a> - When a visitor loads a page.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/event-types/scroll-event/\"><strong>Scroll</strong></a> - When a visitor scrolls through a page, vertically or horizontally.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/event-types/element-visibility-event/\"><strong>Element Visibility</strong></a> - When the page displays a screen element to a visitor.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/event-types/browser-history-change-event/\"><strong>Browser History Change</strong></a> - When a visitor navigates through a single page application (SPA).</li>\n<li><a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/event-types/hash-change-event/\"><strong>Hash Change</strong></a> - When the anchor part of the page&rsquo;s URL after the hash symbol (<code>#</code>) changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of these events is preconfigured with a <code>tealium_event</code> value specific to that event (for example, <code>scroll</code> for scroll events). Some of these event types include additional event variables by default, and you can customize or add event variables as needed.</p>\n<p>For more information, see <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/getting-started/best-practices/#event-tracking\">Best Practices - Event tracking</a>.</p>\n"

We recommend that you use the <strong>DOM Ready</strong> scope. For more information, see <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/event-scope/\">Event score</a>.</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Tracking Event</strong>, select the tracking event for the event listener from the list. If you plan to subscribe a tag to this event listener, be sure to select a tracking event that is supported by the tag, or the event listener will not work with that tag.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>View</strong> – Track when a visitor views a page.</li>\n<li><strong>Link</strong> – Track when a visitor interacts with a page, such as clicks, video scrolls, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom</strong> – Enter a custom tracking event in the text box (for example, <code>video</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Publish Locations</strong>, select the publish locations for the event. If you deselect the checkbox for a publish location, the event listener will not be published to that location. For example, if you deselect <strong>Prod</strong>, the event listener will not be pushed to your live site, even if you select <strong>Prod</strong> as a publish target from the <strong>Save</strong> dialog. For more information, see <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/save-publish/about-publishing/\">About publishing</a>.</li>\n<li>In the <strong>Element Selector</strong> box, enter the element ID, class, or selector of the item you want to target. For more information, see <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/selectors/\">Event element selector</a>.</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Event Triggers</strong>, select the event triggers for this event and set the thresholds for those triggers. For more information about each event type&rsquo;s event triggers, read the documentation from our list of <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/event-types/\">Event Types</a>.</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Trigger Frequency</strong>, select whether you want to track every time that event listener is triggered on a page (<strong>Always</strong>) or track only the first time an event is triggered (<strong>Once</strong>). For more information, see <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/triggers-and-frequency/\">Event triggers</a>.</li>\n<li>Configure the trigger variables for the event listener. These are the values sent with the event listener tracking call. You can edit existing trigger variables or add new ones to collect additional data with the visitor actions. For more information about variables, see <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/variables/\">Event Variables</a>.

For example, if you have a mouseover event with a complex set of rules that you want to apply to another element on a page, duplicate that event listener and change the <strong>Element Selector</strong> in the duplicate to the new element.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>From the <strong>Events</strong> screen, click the event you want to duplicate.</li>\n<li>In the <strong>Event Details</strong> slideout, click <strong>Duplicate</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click the duplicate event in the <strong>Events</strong> dashboard.</li>\n<li>In the <strong>Configuration</strong> tab, click <strong>Edit</strong>.</li>\n<li>Enter a unique name and customize settings for the event listener.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"view-event-details\">View event details</h2>\n<p>Go to <strong>Events</strong> and click an event to see and edit the event listener details.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>Configuration</strong> tab displays the title, scope, tracking event, triggers, occurrence, conditions, and trigger variables for the event listener.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Rules</strong> tab displays the logical conditions of the event listener.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Tags</strong> tab displays a list of the tags and their relationship to to the event listener:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>All Pages and Events</strong> - The tag is not subscribed to the event listener.

Load rules are reevaluated after each tracking call.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We recommend using the default scope of <strong>DOM Ready</strong> for standard site implementations and <strong>After Load Rules</strong> for Single Page Applications (SPA). DOM Ready ensures that the visitor&rsquo;s browser loads all of the page elements for tracking, while SPAs may use fewer DOM event listeners and give you a limited view of the trackable elements. When you use <strong>After Load Rules</strong> for an SPA, the load rules are reevaluated after every event to see if the criteria has changed to load the event listener on the page.</p>\n<p>In most standard implementations, the <strong>DOM Ready</strong> scope occurs sequentially after <strong>After Load Rules</strong>, but this timing is not guaranteed.</p>\n<p>For a detailed overview of event execution order, see <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/getting-started/order-of-operations/\">Order of Operations</a>.</p>\n"
