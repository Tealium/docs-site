When a visitor performs the action, a tracking call is triggered that includes the event listener variables.</p><p>With no-code event listeners, you can do the following:</p><ul><li>Configure an event listener for your own unique needs.</li><li>Select from various scopes that determine when the event listener loads on the page.</li><li>Set up advanced rule logic to determine which pages load the event listeners.</li><li>Set unique Event Triggers that you can configure based on your tracking needs.</li><li>Target specific elements on the page with event listeners.</li><li>Configure a data payload to be sent when the action takes place.</li></ul><h2 id=\"event-types-and-variables\">Event types and variables</h2><p>The following types of events are available through this feature:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/event-types/click-event/\"><strong>Click</strong></a> - When a visitor clicks their mouse on a page.</li><li><a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/event-types/mouseover-event/\"><strong>Mouseover</strong></a> - When a visitor hovers their mouse over a specific element on a page.</li><li><a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/event-types/form-submission-event/\"><strong>Form Submission</strong></a> - When a visitor submits a form on a page.</li><li><a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/event-types/youtube-event/\"><strong>YouTube</strong></a> - When a visitor interacts with an embedded YouTube video on a page.</li><li><a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/event-types/vimeo-event/\"><strong>Vimeo</strong></a> - When a visitor interacts with an embedded Vimeo video on a page.</li><li><a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/event-types/html5-video-event/\"><strong>HTML5 Video</strong></a> - When a visitor interacts with an embedded HTML5 video on a page.</li><li><a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/event-types/page-load-event/\"><strong>Page Load</strong></a> - When a visitor loads a page.</li><li><a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/event-types/scroll-event/\"><strong>Scroll</strong></a> - When a visitor scrolls through a page, vertically or horizontally.</li><li><a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/event-types/element-visibility-event/\"><strong>Element Visibility</strong></a> - When the page displays a screen element to a visitor.</li><li><a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/event-types/browser-history-change-event/\"><strong>Browser History Change</strong></a> - When a visitor navigates through a single page application (SPA).</li><li><a href=\"/iq-tag-management/events/event-types/hash-change-event/\"><strong>Hash Change</strong></a> - When the anchor part of the page&rsquo;s URL after the hash symbol (<code>#</code>) changes.</li></ul><p>Each of these events is preconfigured with a <code>tealium_event</code> value specific to that event (for example, <code>scroll</code> for scroll events).

DOM Ready ensures that the visitor&rsquo;s browser loads all of the page elements for tracking, while SPAs may use fewer DOM event listeners and give you a limited view of the trackable elements. When you use <strong>After Load Rules</strong> for an SPA, the load rules are reevaluated after every event to see if the criteria has changed to load the event listener on the page.</p><p>In most standard implementations, the <strong>DOM Ready</strong> scope occurs sequentially after <strong>After Load Rules</strong>, but this timing is not guaranteed.</p><p>For a detailed overview of event execution order, see <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/getting-started/order-of-operations/\">Order of Operations</a>.</p>"
