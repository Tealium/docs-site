This process may take longer than 24 hours to complete, and the action cannot be undone.</p>\n<p>Deleting a visitor record permanently removes its data from all components of the Customer Data Hub.</p>\n<p>When you click <strong>Delete Visitor</strong>, a request is logged to our system to delete the visitor record and a transaction ID is returned to log the request.

Select the API call you want to make and adjust the placeholder values in the request URL.</p>\n<p>Each API call is available in the <strong>Request Types</strong> drop-down list.
