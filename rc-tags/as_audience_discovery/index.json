            "body":"<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2><p>Audience Discovery simplifies the discovery process by providing simple point-and-click tools with rich filtering capabilities. Audience Discovery uses your historical data and adapts to your visitor schema to display real time charts of the metrics, properties, and badges you define, as you define them.</p><p>Using the <strong>Audience Discovery</strong> interface, you can quickly and easily:</p><ul><li>Zoom in on the visual representation of your data to discover audiences that meet your filtering criteria</li><li>Create specific audiences to target</li><li>Filter a selected audience on-the-fly to fine tune your target visitor segment</li><li>Overlay statistics to compare data</li><li>View your audiences from a variety of perspectives</li></ul><p>Before you begin, it is important to familiarize yourself with the components of the interface and how to navigate the <strong>Audience Discovery</strong> user interface.</p><h3 id=\"attributes-audiences-and-perspectives\">Attributes, audiences, and perspectives</h3><p>To filter your data for use with Audience Discovery, it is important to understand the differences between data attributes, audiences, and perspectives.</p><ul><li><p><strong><a href=\"/server-side/attributes/about/\">Attributes</a></strong><br>In Audience Discovery, attributes are used to define the data in your data layer that is associated to the properties of a visitor, the characteristics of a visitor session, and event data collected during the visitor session. For example, a visitor attribute contains event data specific to the visitor, such as the email address or member ID for the visitor, whereas a visit attribute contains event data specific to the site visit, such as a product category viewed or the date of the last visit.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href=\"/server-side/audiences/create-an-audience/\">Audiences</a></strong><br>An audience is a group of visitors that are identified by a shared set of attributes. Attributes assigned to an audience are used to identify distinct groups visitors to your site. The more attributes you select for an audience, the more specific your audience becomes. Audiences are used to trigger connector actions. Once an audience is created, that audience can be targeted with an email campaign, coupon, or other action.</p></li><li><p><strong>Perspectives</strong><br>Perspectives are specific views of your audiences. For example, selecting, the badge perspective enables you to view visitors from the perspective of the badges they are assigned, such as <strong>Frequent Visitor</strong>.</p></li></ul><h3 id=\"daily-visitor-query-cap\">Daily visitor query cap</h3><p>Visitors are sampled by capping the daily visitor count, which determines the sample size of visitors used to project results in Audience Sizing and Audience Discovery queries. The progress bar displays the progress of this calculation. The actual query runs on the total visitors matched, not just the capped visitors. Likewise, jobs also run on the total number of matched visitors, not just the sampled visitors.</p><p>The <strong>Sample Size of Daily Visitors to Process</strong> profile setting can only be modified by Tealium staff. To adjust this setting, contact your account representative.</p><figure><img src=\"https://community.tealiumiq.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/8531iF2784EBE07AFABA4/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999\"         alt=\"Daily Visitor Query Cap Setting\"         title=\"Daily Visitor Query Cap Setting\"/></figure>"
