            "body": "<p>This tool offers full access to customize the code behind the prompt as well as the option to use translated content for global customers. This feature replaces the functionality previously offered by the Privacy Manager extension and is part of our consent management features designed to help you stay compliant with <a href=\"/glossary/#opt-in-model-consent\">Opt-in model regulations</a> like GDPR.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n<p>The Explicit Consent Prompt Manager works together with the <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/consent/consent-management/consent-preferences-dialog/about/\">Consent Preferences Manager</a> to present tracking options to your customers. A consent prompt notifies your customers about your desire to track their activity on your digital property and to acquire their consent. Explicit consent is a proactive approach in encouraging your customers to opt-in or opt-out by forcing a pop-up prompt until a selection is made.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a customer opts-out, the website suppresses all tracking activity and cookie storage that is not directly relevant to the digital experience.</li>\n<li>If the customer opts-in, the website can track the user behavior (commonly using third-party services).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Explicit Consent Prompt example:</p>\n<figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/iq-tag-management/example-consent-prompt.png\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/iq-tag-management/example-consent-prompt.png\"\n         alt=\"Example Consent Prompt\"\n         title=\"Example Consent Prompt\" width=\"475\" height=\"289\"/>\n    </a>\n</figure>\n<p>The Explicit Consent Prompt Manager in iQ Tag Management makes it easy to create and deploy a consent prompt to your website using your existing installation. This feature can be used with the <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/consent/consent-management/consent-preferences-dialog/\">Consent Preferences Manager</a> to offer your customers more granular control over how they are tracked.</p>\n<p>The Explicit Consent Prompt satisfies a requirement of the General Data Protection Regulation that a data subject (EU residents) must give explicit consent before activity can be tracked.</p>\n<h2 id=\"visitor-experience\">Visitor experience</h2>\n<p>After you deploy to your website using the standard iQ JavaScript container ( <code>utag.js</code> ), the consent prompt operates automatically – no additional coding is needed for the consent prompt to function. The prompt behavior is based on the configured load rule and the presence of a consent cookie. The prompt is triggered automatically on pages matching the load rule if that cookie is not detected. After a response to the prompt is submitted (for example, the visitor selects <strong>Opt-in</strong> or <strong>Opt-out</strong>), the consent cookie is created and subsequent page views do not trigger the consent prompt.</p>\n<p class=\"tip\"><i class=\"fa fa-info-circle\"></i>The consent prompt can be displayed programmatically <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/consent-management/explicit-consent-prompt/manage/#javascript-helper-functions\">using the JavaScript helper functions</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"features\">Features</h2>\n<p>The Explicit Consent Prompt in Tealium iQ offers the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Display Templates</li>\n<li>Customizable Style and Layout</li>\n<li>Multi-Language Support</li>\n<li>Configurable Display Condition</li>\n<li>Global Settings for Enterprise Rollout</li>\n<li>Consent Logging (requires DataAccess or EventStream)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This feature does not require additional code on your site. All of the configuration is bundled with your existing installation of our JavaScript library (<code>utag.js</code>).</p>\n<p class=\"note\"><i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-triangle\"></i>After you configure and activate the consent prompt, the changes are released in your next publish.</p>\n<h2 id=\"steps\">Steps</h2>\n<p>The Explicit Consent Prompt is set up using the following screens:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Content</strong>\nUse this screen to enter the message displayed to your customers, add multiple language translations, and provide your company&rsquo;s logo URL and privacy policy link.</li>\n<li><strong>Customization</strong>\nCustomize the design and layout of your prompt by editing the CSS, HTML, and JavaScript used to display your prompt.</li>\n<li><strong>Enforcement Rule</strong>\nUse your data layer to create a load rule that determines when to display the consent prompt.</li>\n<li><strong>Options</strong>\nAdjust additional options, such as logging consent changes using DataAccess or marking non-tracking tags that are not governed by consent management, such as chat widget.</li>\n<li><strong>Default Consent Categories (JavaScript Code Extension when Consent Preferences is disabled)</strong><br>\nIf you do not use the <strong>Consent Preferences Dialog</strong> and have a server-side product enabled (EventStream, AudienceStream, or DataAccess), then this JavaScript Code extension is required to set the default consent categories.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"note\"><i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-triangle\"></i>If you skip this step, incoming events might be ignored.</p>\n<h2 id=\"global-settings\">Global settings</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Explicit Consent Prompt</strong> can be configured for multiple profiles simultaneously when using the global parameters setting. This allows you to configure your consent prompt at the account level and have each profile inherit that configuration.</p>\n<p>To learn more, see <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/consent/consent-management/global-parameters/\">Managing Global Consent Content</a>.</p>\n"

            "body": "<p>This tool adds the ability to add a privacy banner and popup to your site to inform your visitors about your sale of personal information policy and to provide opt-out options. The <a href=\"/glossary/#opt-out-model-consent\">Opt-out</a> Consent Manager can be fully customized to match your site requirements and it supports translated content for your global visitors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n<p>The Opt-out Consent Manager notifies your users of your policy for processing personal information and allows them to opt-out of the sale of their personal information or control how their personal information is sold. This solution can be deployed to your site either as a privacy banner and popup or just as a popup to integrate with your existing banner.</p>\n<p>The banner informs your users about your policy and provides a link to your <strong>Do Not Sell My Information</strong> page required opt-out models such as CCPA. The popup is triggered from the banner and allows a visitor to opt-out of the sale of personal information or set preferences for the sale of their personal information.</p>\n<p>This feature is integrated with your Tealium iQ Tag Management account to make it easy to configure and categorize vendor tags that might be governed by CCPA. The tags that you identify as selling information can be categorized as <strong>Dot Not Sell</strong> and presented to your users in the popup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"visitor-experience\">Visitor experience</h2>\n<p>After the Opt-out Consent Manager is deployed to your website using the Universal Tag (<code>utag.js</code>), it operates automatically – no additional coding is needed for it to function. The banner and popup is displayed based on the configured load rule and the presence of a <code>do_not_sell</code> cookie. When the cookie is not set, the Opt-out model is triggered automatically on pages that match the load rule.

We recommend selecting the banner and popup as the most complete solution. However, if you already display a cookie banner on your site, the popup option is best.</li>\n<li><strong>Content</strong>\nUse this screen to enter the message displayed to your customers on the banner and popup, add multiple language translations, and provide your company&rsquo;s logo URL and privacy policy link.</li>\n<li><strong>Customization</strong>\nCustomize the design and layout of your prompt by editing the CSS, HTML, and JavaScript used to display your prompt.</li>\n<li><strong>Enforcement Rule</strong>\nUse your data layer to create a load rule that determines when the banner should be displayed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This feature does not require additional code on your site.

These categories are presented to the customer and displayed as toggle buttons to allow or disallow that tracking to occur. For example, if a user opts out of the <code>Marketing</code> category, tags categorized in the marketing category are suppressed. If needed, customers can still access their preference selections about the types of tracking they allow by using the consent preferences popup.</p>\n<p class=\"note\"><i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-triangle\"></i>The Consent Preferences Manager automatically suppresses tags in opted-out categories from loading.</p>\n<p>Preferences popup example:</p>\n<figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/iq-tag-management/consent-preferences-prompt.png\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/iq-tag-management/consent-preferences-prompt.png\"\n         alt=\"Consent Preferences Prompt\"\n         title=\"Consent Preferences Prompt\" width=\"451\" height=\"322\"/>\n    </a>\n</figure>\n<p>The iQ Tag Management Consent Preferences Manager simplifies the creation and deployment of a tracking preferences prompt to your website using your existing installation.

Only connector actions in the categories that the customer has opted into are triggered.</p>\n<h4 id=\"example\">Example</h4>\n<p>You have two connectors configured, one for <code>Analytics</code> and one for <code>Personalization</code>. A customer grants partial consent in the preference form by allowing <code>Analytics</code> tracking but not allowing <code>Personalization</code>.</p>\n<figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/iq-tag-management/consent-server-side-categories-example.png\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/iq-tag-management/consent-server-side-categories-example.png\"\n         alt=\"Server-side Categories Example\"\n         title=\"Server-side Categories Example\"/>\n    </a>\n</figure>\n<p>Only connector actions in the <code>Analytics</code> category are triggered. Any connector action categorized as <code>Personalization</code> is suppressed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"audiencestream-consent-category\">AudienceStream consent category</h2>\n<p>Tealium AudienceStream is categorized in the <code>CDP</code> consent category. In order for attributes and connectors to be processed in AudienceStream, the visitor must be opted into the <code>CDP</code> category.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dataaccess-consent-category\">DataAccess consent category</h2>\n<p>EventStore and EventDB are categorized in the <code>Big Data</code> consent category. To store event data in EventStore and EventDB, the visitor must be opted into the <code>Big Data</code> category.</p>\n<p>AudienceDB is categorized in the <code>CDP</code> consent category. To store audience data in AudienceDB, the visitor must be opted into the <code>CDP</code> category.</p>\n<h2 id=\"features\">Features</h2>\n<p>The Consent Preferences Manager offers the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Display Templates</li>\n<li>Customizable Style and Layout</li>\n<li>Multi-Language Support</li>\n<li>Tag Categories</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of the configuration is bundled with your existing installation of the JavaScript library (utag.js).</p>\n<p class=\"note\"><i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-triangle\"></i>After you activate and configure the preferences prompt, the changes are released in your next publish.</p>\n<h2 id=\"global-settings\">Global settings</h2>\n<p>The Consent Preferences Manager is configurable for multiple profiles simultaneously when using global settings.
