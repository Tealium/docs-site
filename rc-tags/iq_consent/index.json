This feature replaces the functionality previously offered by the Privacy Manager extension and is part of our consent management features designed to help you stay compliant with <a href=\"/glossary/#opt-in-model-consent\">Opt-in model regulations</a> like GDPR.</p><h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2><p>The Explicit Consent Prompt Manager works together with the <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/consent/consent-management/consent-preferences-dialog/about/\">Consent Preferences Manager</a> to present tracking options to your customers. A consent prompt notifies your customers about your desire to track their activity on your digital property and to acquire their consent. Explicit consent is a proactive approach in encouraging your customers to opt-in or opt-out by forcing a pop-up prompt until a selection is made.</p><ul><li>If a customer opts-out, the website suppresses all tracking activity and cookie storage that is not directly relevant to the digital experience.</li><li>If the customer opts-in, the website can track the user behavior (commonly using third-party services).</li></ul><p>Explicit Consent Prompt example:</p><figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/iq-tag-management/example-consent-prompt.png\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/iq-tag-management/example-consent-prompt.png\"         alt=\"Example Consent Prompt\"         title=\"Example Consent Prompt\" width=\"475\" height=\"289\"/>    </a></figure><p>The Explicit Consent Prompt Manager in iQ Tag Management makes it easy to create and deploy a consent prompt to your website using your existing installation. This feature can be used with the <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/consent/consent-management/consent-preferences-dialog/\">Consent Preferences Manager</a> to offer your customers more granular control over how they are tracked.</p><p>The Explicit Consent Prompt satisfies a requirement of the General Data Protection Regulation that a data subject (EU residents) must give explicit consent before activity can be tracked.</p><h2 id=\"visitor-experience\">Visitor experience</h2><p>After you deploy to your website using the standard iQ JavaScript container ( <code>utag.js</code> ), the consent prompt operates automatically – no additional coding is needed for the consent prompt to function. The prompt behavior is based on the configured load rule and the presence of a consent cookie. The prompt is triggered automatically on pages matching the load rule if that cookie is not detected. After a response to the prompt is submitted (for example, the visitor selects <strong>Opt-in</strong> or <strong>Opt-out</strong>), the consent cookie is created and subsequent page views do not trigger the consent prompt.</p><p class=\"tip\"><i class=\"fa fa-info-circle\"></i>The consent prompt can be displayed programmatically <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/consent-management/explicit-consent-prompt/manage/#javascript-helper-functions\">using the JavaScript helper functions</a>.</p><h2 id=\"features\">Features</h2><p>The Explicit Consent Prompt in Tealium iQ offers the following features:</p><ul><li>Display Templates</li><li>Customizable Style and Layout</li><li>Multi-Language Support</li><li>Configurable Display Condition</li><li>Global Settings for Enterprise Rollout</li><li>Consent Logging (requires DataAccess or EventStream)</li></ul><p>This feature does not require additional code on your site.

This solution can be deployed to your site either as a privacy banner and popup or just as a popup to integrate with your existing banner.</p><p>The banner informs your users about your policy and provides a link to your <strong>Do Not Sell My Information</strong> page required opt-out models such as CCPA. The popup is triggered from the banner and allows a visitor to opt-out of the sale of personal information or set preferences for the sale of their personal information.</p><p>This feature is integrated with your Tealium iQ Tag Management account to make it easy to configure and categorize vendor tags that might be governed by CCPA.

These categories are presented to the customer and displayed as toggle buttons to allow or disallow that tracking to occur. For example, if a user opts out of the <code>Marketing</code> category, tags categorized in the marketing category are suppressed.
