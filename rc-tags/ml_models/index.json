            "body": "<p class=\"note\"><i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-triangle\"></i>Interested in Predict?<br>\nPredict is an add-on feature for customers who have AudienceStream. If you are already a Tealium customer, contact your Customer Success Manager for a demo and to learn more about Predict. If you are a new customer, <a href=\"https://tealium.com/predict-demo/\">contact us</a> to request a demo.</p>\n<p>Tealium Predict is a built-in machine learning technology product used with the Tealium AudienceStream CDP product that takes a complicated discipline (machine learning) and distills it down to a fully managed feature. Tealium Predict works with Tealium AudienceStream to build and create more intelligent audiences and activate trustworthy machine learning insights.</p>\n<figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/predict/high-level-predict-flow.png\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/predict/high-level-predict-flow.png\"\n         alt=\"High level Predict flow.png\"\n         title=\"High level Predict flow.png\"/>\n    </a>\n</figure>\n<p>Using Tealium Predict, you can create, optimize, and deploy data models that make meaningful predictions about visitor behavior allowing you to determine:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The driving factors that influence your key performance indicators (KPIs). For example, which types of customers are likely to make online purchases.</li>\n<li>Which marketing channels within your website drive purchases.</li>\n<li>Categories of online visitor segmentation to apply successful customer personalization.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Deployed models are managed by Tealium in real-time using a predictive output attribute that is made available to you after your model is trained and deployed. In just a few clicks, you can create audiences by categorizing visitors based model scores and target them with personalized experiences to drive ROI.</p>\n<h2 id=\"data-compliance\">Data compliance</h2>\n<p>For information about data compliance and security, see the <a href=\"https://tealium.com/terms/\">Tealium Customer Protection Package</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"key-benefits\">Key benefits</h2>\n<p>Key benefits of Tealium Predict include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Leverage Machine Learning Intelligence Across your Entire Implementation</strong><br>\nAutomatically activate predictive insights in any of Tealium&rsquo;s over 1,200 integrations.</li>\n<li><strong>Simplification</strong><br>\nTealium Predict technology simplifies the implementation of machine learning for you without the need for a data scientist or dedicated team. You can create a model, deploy it, and immediately activate the value in AudienceStream without writing a single line of code.</li>\n<li><strong>Predict Customer Actions</strong><br>\nAutomatically draw conclusions about what actions customers are likely to take in the future and design tailored programs that directly address their needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Personalization</strong><br>\nThe Tealium Customer Data Hub lets you pinpoint meaningful visitor personalization data.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce Time Spent on Machine Learning Projects that Involve User Data</strong><br>\nData collection and analysis are natively integrated with machine learning intelligence, greatly reducing time spent on data preparation and activation.</li>\n<li><strong>Score Customers with Predictive Potential</strong><br>\nTechnology built into the model produces a score for visitors with the likelihood to return or complete a specific behavior. You can then leverage the scores to generate audiences for further proactive action, such as re-engagement campaigns.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"customer-use-cases\">Customer use cases</h2>\n<p>To learn more about the real ways that machine learning and customer data can drive revenue through improved customer experiences, see <a href=\"https://tealium.com/blog/data-driven-marketing/tealium-predict-ml-top-5-emerging-machine-learning-use-cases-with-customer-data/\">Tealium Predict ML: Top 5 Emerging Machine Learning Use Cases with Customer Data</a>.

For example, a &ldquo;Likelihood to purchase in 30 days&rdquo; model requires at least 31 days of data. For better training model accuracy, the training time frame should be 90 days regardless of the prediction timeframe selected in the UI.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"data-quality\">Data quality</h2>\n<p>For optimal results, Tealium suggest that you have a high-quality dataset that consists of a clean data layer with a large amount of training data. Better data layer health lets you create models that can provide immediate and meaningful prediction results.</p>\n<p>For additional information, see <a href=\"https://tealium.com/resource/fundamentals/data-readiness-for-ml-checklist/\">Data Readiness for Machine Learning.</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"professional-services\">Professional services</h2>\n<p>Though no coding or data science knowledge is required to use the product, you can improve your results with a high quality implementation of AudienceStream.</p>\n<p>If you would like assistance in assessing the current state of your data layer, Tealium provides professional services centered around your current AudienceStream implementation and overall data wellness.</p>\n<p>For additional information about data readiness and data wellness services, see <a href=\"/predict/strategy/prepare-your-data/\">Prepare your data</a>.</p>\n"

            "body": "<h2 id=\"choosing-thresholds\">Choosing thresholds</h2>\n<p>After a model is deployed and making predictions, a common next step is to use your predictions to create one or more audiences. The prediction values in an Tealium AudienceStream output attribute for any model are decimal numbers in a defined range (0 - 1). The typical approach is to choose one or more thresholds or cutoff points to define which portion of that prediction range you want included in your audience.</p>\n<p>For example, if your model is predicting a likelihood to purchase in the next 3 days, you may want an audience of only the visitors who are most likely to purchase. To achieve this, you can create an audience using a rule that defines the threshold as 0.8 as an example. In this scenario, the audience only includes visitors with values greater than or equal to 0.8.</p>\n<p>There is not one objectively correct threshold value for all audiences, as different audiences serve different business goals and since there are usually substantial variations between models for different target behaviors or among different datasets.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sensitivity-and-specificity\">Sensitivity and specificity</h2>\n<p>To choose the best threshold, consider the potential trade-offs of choosing a threshold that is relatively high or low. For example, a trade-off between ending up with a larger audience that is less accurate or a smaller audience that is more accurate. In statistics terminology, this is known as a trade-off between <em>Sensitivity</em> and <em>Specificity</em>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sensitivity</strong><br>\nSensitivity represents the True Positive Rate or how well the model correctly identifies all visitors who will purchase (using purchase as the behavior your model is predicting).</li>\n<li><strong>Specificity</strong><br>\nSpecificity determines how well a model identifies false values. Specificity is the metric that evaluates a the ability of the model to predict true negatives of each available category. The True Negative Rate shows how well the model correctly identifies all visitors who will not purchase (using purchase as a the behavior your model is predicting).</li>\n</ul>\n"
