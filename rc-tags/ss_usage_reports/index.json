            "body":"<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2><p>Usage reports show metrics for events, visitors, connectors, and functions. This data allows you to analyze how these features are used by various Tealium services in your account and how usage has varied over time. Usage reports also help estimate costs for data usage so that you can make informed decisions about your implementation.</p><h2 id=\"view-usage-reports\">View usage reports</h2><p>Navigate to <strong>Data Supply Chain &gt; Usage Reports</strong> for an account-level view specific to the profile you are logged in as. The default dashboard view varies depending on which profile you are logged into.</p><figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/server-side/usage-reports.png\"><img src=\"/images/server-side/usage-reports.png\"         alt=\"Usage reports\"         title=\"Usage reports\"/>    </a></figure><h3 id=\"view-reports-for-a-profile\">View reports for a profile</h3><p>Use the following steps to view a usage report for a profile:</p><ol><li><p>Go to <strong>Data Supply Chain &gt; Usage Reports</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Select a profile and report type from the drop-down lists.

The date range is plotted on the horizontal axis and the metric, such as the number of events and visitors, is plotted along the vertical axis and marked by dots. Clicking a dot displays the aggregate metric values and the day on which it was aggregated.</p><figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/server-side/whiteui-data-access-usage-reports-click-dot-to-display-metrics.jpg\"><img src=\"/images/server-side/whiteui-data-access-usage-reports-click-dot-to-display-metrics.jpg\"         alt=\"Click Dot to Display Metrics\"         title=\"Click Dot to Display Metrics\"/>    </a></figure><p>You may view reports as part of the <strong>All Usage Report</strong> or select individual report types from the drop-down list.</p><h2 id=\"report-types\">Report types</h2><p>The following lists describe the available report types.</p><ul><li><strong>All Usage Reports</strong><br>Displays all reports sequentially in the reports dashboard.

If the AudienceStream event filter is enabled, this report only includes filtered AudienceStream events.</li></ul></li></ul><p class=\"note\"><i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-triangle\"></i>Data usage cost for AudienceStream is calculated based on the <strong>Total AudienceStream Events</strong> report.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Connector Reports</strong><br>Connector reports correspond to event usage by connectors and return the following reports:</p><ul><li><strong>Total Connector Calls</strong><br>Sum total of server requests made for triggering EventStream and AudienceStream connector actions.</li><li><strong>Connector Calls - EventStream</strong><br>Number of server requests made by EventStream connector actions.

This report returns the number of times the Tealium Collect tag made requests to the AudienceStream data layer for fetching the latest visitor profile.</p></li><li><p><strong>DataAccess Reports</strong><br>Data Access reports correspond to events and audiences exported through the DataAccess service and return the following reports:</p><ul><li><strong>Total DataAccess Records Inserted</strong><br>The sum total of events and visitors exported using DataAccess.</li><li><strong>Total EventDB Events Inserted</strong><br>The number of events exported to the Amazon Redshift database assigned to your account/profile.</li><li><strong>Total EventStore Events Inserted</strong><br>The number of events exported to the Amazon S3 folder assigned to your account/profile.</li><li><strong>Total AudienceDB Visitors Inserted</strong><br>The number of visitors exported to the Amazon Redshift database assigned to your account/profile.</li><li><strong>Total AudienceStore visitors Inserted</strong><br>The number of visitors exported to the Amazon S3 folder assigned to your account/profile.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Functions Reports</strong><br><a href=\"/server-side/functions/about/\">Functions</a> reports show the number of functions triggered and the total execution time of functions by function type.</p><ul><li><strong>Total Invocations Custom Actions</strong><br>The total number of event and visitor functions triggered for the selected profile.</li><li><strong>Total Invocations Transformations</strong><br>The total number of data transformation functions triggered for the selected profile.</li><li><strong>Total Execution Time Custom Actions, hours</strong><br>The total execution time of all event and visitor functions for the selected profile.</li><li><strong>Total Execution Time Transformations, hours</strong><br>The total execution time of all data transformation functions for the selected profile.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=\"billing-estimation\">Billing estimation</h2><p>Usage costs for EventStream, EventDB, and EventStore products, as well as customers with EDF and CDH bundles are calculated based on the <strong>Total Inbound Events</strong> report, which includes the total volume of events flowing into your account.</p><p>Usage costs for AudienceStream, AudienceDB, AudienceStore and Predict products are calculated based on the <strong>AudienceStream Filtered Events</strong> report.</p><p>Every event, at its point of entry into the Tealium Customer Data Hub, counts towards the total volume and is charged equally.</p><p class=\"note\"><i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-triangle\"></i>Usage reports do not provide billing or pricing information. Your final usage cost is determined not just by your event volume, but also by your contract terms and implementation setup. Contact your account manager for all billing and pricing inquiries.</p><h2 id=\"faq\">FAQ</h2><h3 id=\"why-cant-i-see-todays-data-in-my-reports\">Why can&rsquo;t I see today&rsquo;s data in my reports?</h3><p>Usage reports can take up to 48 hours to completely process and display the data flowing through Customer Data Hub. If your date range only spans the last 24-48 hours, you may not see data populated in the reports. As a best practice, choose an end date that is at least 48 hours back from the current date.</p><h3 id=\"why-cant-i-choose-a-date-prior-to-april-1-2016\">Why can&rsquo;t I choose a date prior to April 1, 2016?</h3><p>Usage reports provide data for up to one year from the time of their release. This method provides most accounts with the data they need to evaluate their annual billing cycle.</p>"
