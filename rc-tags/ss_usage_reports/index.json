            "body":"<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2><p>Usage reports show the volume of data and number of operations associated with your account or profile. Use these reports to analyze the amount of data flowing through each point of the data supply chain and to estimate your billing costs for each feature.</p><p>Reports are available for all profiles in the account or for a specific profile. Report data can be adjusted to a specific date range.</p><h2 id=\"billing-estimation\">Billing estimation</h2><p>Usage costs for Tealium EventStream, Tealium EventDB, and Tealium EventStore, as well as customers with EDF and CDH bundles, are calculated based on the <a href=\"#data-collection-reports\"><strong>Total Inbound Events</strong></a> report. This report represents the total volume of events flowing into your account.</p><p>Usage costs for Tealium AudienceStream, Tealium AudienceDB, Tealium AudienceStore, and Tealium Predict are calculated based on the <strong>AudienceStream Filtered Events</strong> report.</p><p>Every event, at its point of entry into the Tealium Customer Data Hub, counts towards the total volume and is charged equally.</p><p class=\"note\"><i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-triangle\"></i>Usage reports do not provide billing or pricing information. Your final usage cost is determined by a combination of your event volume, your contract terms, and your implementation setup. Contact your account manager for all billing and pricing inquiries.</p><h2 id=\"graph-format\">Graph format</h2><p>Reports are displayed as line graphs. The date range is plotted on the horizontal axis and the metric is plotted along the vertical axis and marked by dots. Hovering over a dot displays the aggregate metric values and the day on which it was aggregated.</p><figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/server-side/whiteui-data-access-usage-reports-click-dot-to-display-metrics.jpg\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/server-side/whiteui-data-access-usage-reports-click-dot-to-display-metrics.jpg\"         alt=\"Click Dot to Display Metrics\"         title=\"Click Dot to Display Metrics\"/>    </a></figure><h2 id=\"available-reports\">Available reports</h2><p>The following lists describe the available report types.</p><ul><li><strong>All Usage Reports</strong><br>Displays all reports sequentially in the reports dashboard.

The number of connector calls contracted with EventStream is based on this report.</li><li><strong>Connector Calls - AudienceStream</strong><br>Number of server requests made by AudienceStream connector actions.</li></ul><h3 id=\"dataaccess-reports\">DataAccess Reports</h3><p>DataAccess reports show the number of records stored in AudienceStore, EventStore, AudienceDB, and EventDB:</p><ul><li><strong>Total DataAccess Records Inserted</strong><br>The number of event and visitor records stored for all DataAccess products.</li><li><strong>Total EventDB Events Inserted</strong><br>The number of event records inserted to EventDB.</li><li><strong>Total EventStore Events Inserted</strong><br>The number of event records stored in EventStore.</li><li><strong>Total AudienceDB Visitors Inserted</strong><br>The number of visitor records inserted to AudienceDB.</li><li><strong>Total AudienceStore visitors Inserted</strong><br>The number of visitor records stored in AudienceStore.</li></ul><h3 id=\"data-collection-reports\">Data Collection Reports</h3><p>Data Collection reports correspond to real-time and offline events flowing into your Customer Data Hub profile and return the following reports:</p><ul><li><strong>Total Inbound Events</strong><br>The sum total of real-time and file import events. Data usage cost for EventStream is calculated based on the <strong>Total Inbound Events</strong> report.</li><li><strong>Total Real-time Events</strong><br>The number of events that are captured by the <a href=\"/client-side-tags/tealium-collect-tag/\">Tealium Collect</a> tag from your website or mobile app in the date range specified.

For more information, see <a href=\"/server-side/consent/consent-management/#audiencestream-processing\">AudienceStream processing</a>.</li><li><strong>Exceeding data size limits</strong><br>To ensure the stability of the platform, event or visitor data exceeding specified size limits may not be processed. These measures safeguard against overloading the system to maintain optimal performance for all customers.

If your date range only spans the last 24-48 hours, you may not see data populated in the reports. Be sure to choose a start date that is 3 or more days before the current date.</p><p><strong>Why can&rsquo;t I choose a date prior to April 1, 2016?</strong></p><p>Usage reports provide data for up to one year from the time of their release. This method provides most accounts with the data they need to evaluate their annual billing cycle.</p>"
