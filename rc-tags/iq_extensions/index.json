Here are the main concepts to know that relate to <code>utag.js</code>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Request and Response</strong><br>\nThe browser requests the page located at a URL and the raw page content (HTML) is returned.</li>\n<li><strong>Build</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The browser begins to parse the HTML document, from the top to the bottom. It must process various elements as they are encountered, such as images, links, text, or scripts like the Universal Tag (<code>utag.js</code>).</li>\n<li>The browser continues to download these elements as it encounters them while it downloads the HTML document itself.</li>\n<li>Synchronous scripts force the browser to stop and interpret the script before continuing. Asynchronous scripts, like utag.js, allow the browser to continue processing while the script is loaded.</li>\n<li>When the browser is done building the HTML of the page it is commonly called the &ldquo;DOM Ready&rdquo; event.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Render</strong><br>\nThe browser renders the web page (DOM) on the screen.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"order-of-operations-overview\">Order of operations overview</h2>\n<p>The default order of operations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>utag Sync</strong> (when enabled)</li>\n<li><strong>Pre Loader</strong> (extensions)\n<ul>\n<li>Prompt for Privacy Consent</li>\n<li>Process Data Layer</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Before Load Rules</strong> (extensions)\n<ul>\n<li>Process Load Rules</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>After Load Rules</strong> (extensions)</li>\n<li><strong>Prioritized Tags</strong></li>\n<li><strong>DOM Ready</strong> (tags and extensions)</li>\n<li><strong>After Tags</strong> (extensions)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"order-of-operations-details\">Order of operations details</h2>\n<p>The following sections provide a step-by-step overview of the order of operations of the Universal Tag (<code>utag.js</code>) to show how it processes the data layer and executes extensions and tags.</p>\n<p class=\"note\"><i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-triangle\"></i>Within each scope, tags and extensions run in the order that they appear in the <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/extensions/load-order-manager/\">Load Order Manager</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"utag-sync-optional\">utag Sync (Optional)</h3>\n<p>Extensions scoped to <strong>utag Sync</strong> load from the <code>utag.sync.js</code> file. These extensions run once before anything else is processed, including extensions scoped to <strong>Pre Loader</strong>.</p>\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/getting-started/install/utag-sync/\">using utag.sync.js</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pre-loader\">Pre loader</h3>\n<p>Extensions scoped to <strong>Pre Loader</strong> run before anything else is processed. Due to this, it is important that they do not have dependencies on other parts of <code>utag.js</code> that run later (data layer, other extensions, et cetera.).</p>\n<h4 id=\"prompt-for-privacy-consent-optional\">Prompt for privacy consent (Optional)</h4>\n<p>After Pre Loader extensions are complete, and if you have the Consent Manager enabled, the prompt for consent is run.</p>\n<h4 id=\"process-data-layer\">Process data layer</h4>\n<p>After Pre Loader extensions are complete, the Universal Tag is initialized and the data layer is processed. During this step the Universal Data Object (<code>utag_data</code>) is combined with data from the rest of the web page such as, first-party cookies, meta tags, query string parameters, and global JavaScript variables, to form the final data layer object, <code>utag.data</code>. The data from this object can be used in your iQ configuration.</p>\n<h3 id=\"before-load-rules\">Before load rules</h3>\n<p>After the data layer object is processed, the extensions scoped to <strong>Before Load Rules</strong> are run. The effects of these extensions can impact all tags and load rules.</p>\n<h4 id=\"process-load-rules\">Process load rules</h4>\n<p>Load rules are evaluated to determine which tags to load. If a tag is configured to load at the DOM Ready event, its load rule will be re-evaluated at that time using the current data object values.</p>\n<h3 id=\"after-load-rules\">After load rules</h3>\n<p>After the load rules are evaluated, the extensions scoped to <strong>After Load Rules</strong> are run. The effects of these extensions can impact all tags.</p>\n<h3 id=\"prioritized-tags\">Prioritized tags</h3>\n<p>Tags with <strong>Tag Timing</strong> set to <strong>Prioritized</strong> are run based on the evaluated load rules.</p>\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"#tag-timing\">tag timing</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dom-ready-tags-and-extensions\">DOM ready (tags and extensions)</h3>\n<p>Tags and extensions scoped to <strong>DOM Ready</strong> are run when the browser signals the DOM Ready event. Tags are loaded into the page as separate files, such as <code>utag.21.js</code>, and are loaded asynchronously to optimize page performance and visitor experience. The exact order of the DOM Ready extensions and tags cannot be guaranteed.</p>\n<p>Each tag loaded on the page runs its tag-scoped extensions and applies its data mappings before it fires.</p>\n<h3 id=\"after-tags\">After tags</h3>\n<p>After the tags are run the extensions scoped to <strong>After Tags</strong> are run.</p>\n<h3 id=\"about-single-page-applications\">About single page applications</h3>\n<p>When you use <code>utag.view()</code> to track screen views manually, load rules are re-evaluated upon each call. <a href=\"/release-notes/?filter=tealium-universal-tag#tealium-universal-tag-2014-01-01\"><code>utag.js</code> versions 4.26</a> and later. Versions of the Universal Tag prior to 4.26 do not re-evaluate load rules when calling <code>utag.view()</code> .</p>\n<p>Additionally, the behavior of load rules can be controlled using a configuration option called <code>load_rules_at_wait</code>, available in versions 4.26 and later of the Universal Tag. This is a legacy customization and we recommend that you contact your customer success manager before implementing it.</p>\n<p>Learn more about the <a href=\"/platforms/javascript/settings/\">configuration settings of the Universal Tag</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"glossary-of-terms\">Glossary of terms</h2>\n<h3 id=\"data-mappings\">Data mappings</h3>\n<p>When you map a Tealium variable to a vendor variable, you create a connection between them called a data mapping. Data mappings are how you configure what data gets sent to your tags.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dom\">DOM</h3>\n<p>DOM is an acronym for Document Object Model. The DOM is the hierarchical representation of a web page that provides a way to interact with its elements.</p>\n<h3 id=\"extension-scope\">Extension scope</h3>\n<p>Extension scope indicates when an extension executes during the processing of utag.js. Extensions can be scoped to Pre Loader, Before Load Rules, After Load Rules, a specific vendor tag (tag-scope), or to the DOM Ready event.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tag-bundling\">Tag bundling</h3>\n<p>Tag bundling is a setting that reduces the number of requests to fetch utag files. Rather than making individual requests for each tag (<code>utag.#.js</code>), the contents of those files are included (bundled) in the original file, <code>utag.js</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tag-timing\">Tag timing</h3>\n<p><strong>Tag Timing</strong> is an advanced tag setting that determines when the tag fires in the order of operations. The options are: <code>Prioritized</code> and <code>DOM Ready</code>.</p>\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/tags/about/\">advanced tag settings</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"utagview\">utag.view()</h3>\n<p>The <code>utag.view()</code> function is used to track page view events. When the utag.js file loads on a page, it automatically calls this function to track the initial page load as a page view event.</p>\n<figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/iq-tag-management/utag.js-order-of-operations-simplified.jpg\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/iq-tag-management/utag.js-order-of-operations-simplified.jpg\"\n         alt=\"order-of-operations simplified\"\n         title=\"order-of-operations simplified\"/>\n    </a>\n</figure>\n<h4 id=\"utag-waterfall---tag-timing--prioritized\">utag Waterfall - Tag Timing = &ldquo;Prioritized&rdquo;</h4>\n<figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/iq-tag-management/utag-waterfall-non-ready-wait.png\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/iq-tag-management/utag-waterfall-non-ready-wait.png\"\n         alt=\"waterfall non-ready-wait\"\n         title=\"waterfall non-ready-wait\"/>\n    </a>\n</figure>\n<h4 id=\"utag-waterfall---tag-timing--dom-ready\">utag Waterfall - Tag Timing = &ldquo;DOM Ready&rdquo;</h4>\n<figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/iq-tag-management/utag-waterfall-with-ready-wait.png\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/iq-tag-management/utag-waterfall-with-ready-wait.png\"\n         alt=\"waterfall with ready-wait.png\"\n         title=\"waterfall with ready-wait.png\"/>\n    </a>\n</figure>\n"

The timing of the extension depends on several factors, including: the scope setting, the execution order setting, and the position of the extension in the list.</p>\n<h2 id=\"understanding-scope\">Understanding scope</h2>\n<p>When adding an extension it is important to understand the <strong>scope</strong> setting. The scope determines which utag file the extension is published in and when the extension runs. Extensions within the same scope will run in the order that they appear in the user interface. The following scope options are available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>utag Sync</strong>: For use with the JavaScript Code or Advanced JavaScript Code extensions. Associates an extension to the <code>utag.sync.js</code> file.</li>\n<li><strong>Pre Loader</strong>: Runs before the data layer is processed and results are applied globally (code appears in utag.js).</li>\n<li><strong>Before Load Rules</strong></li>\n<li><strong>After Load Rules</strong></li>\n<li><strong>DOM Ready Extensions</strong>: Runs once, at the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/DOMContentLoaded\">DOMContentLoaded browser event</a>, the code appears in <code>utag.js</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Tag Scoped Extensions</strong>: Runs only when the specified tags run and changes are only applied for that tag (code appears in tag-specific <code>utag.#.js</code>). Any data layer values modified in this scope will not affect other tags.\n<ul>\n<li>Check <strong>Tag Scoped Extensions</strong> to display <strong>All Tags</strong>, which run after the data layer is processed and changes are applied globally (code appears in <code>utag.js</code>). See Execution Order for more information about exact timing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>After Tags Extensions</strong>: Runs after tags are triggered.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"note\"><i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-triangle\"></i>If you set <strong>Scope</strong> to <strong>utag Sync</strong>, <strong>Pre Loader</strong>, or <strong>DOM Ready Extensions</strong> you must set <strong>Occurrence</strong> to <strong>Run Once</strong>.</p>\n<p>The scopes Pre Loader, All Tags (except for After Tags execution order), and Tag Scope are guaranteed to run in that order, but DOM Ready extensions will execute independently from the other three. In most standard implementations the DOM Ready scope likely occurs sequentially after the other three, but this timing should not be assumed.</p>\n<p class=\"note\"><i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-triangle\"></i>Some extensions, such as E-Commerce, Pathname Tokenizer, jQuery, and onHandler 1.7, have a pre-set scope that cannot be changed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"understanding-execution-order\">Understanding execution order</h2>\n<p>The <strong>execution</strong> setting offers more granular control of the timing of an All Tags extension.</p>\n<p>The following options are available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Before Load Rules</strong> - runs after the data layer is processed (For example, after Pre Loader, but prior to evaluating load rules).</li>\n<li><strong>After Load Rules (default)</strong> - runs after load rules are evaluated.</li>\n<li><strong>After Tags</strong> - runs after tags have been triggered.</li>\n<li><strong>utag Sync</strong> - runs first when using with JavaScript Code or Advanced JavaScript Code extensions by associating the extension to the <code>utag.sync.js</code> file.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a detailed overview of extension execution order see <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/getting-started/order-of-operations/\">Order of Operations</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conditions\">Conditions</h2>\n<p>Some extensions support conditions.
