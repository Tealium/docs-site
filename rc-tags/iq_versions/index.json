The default environments correspond to the following URL paths:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dev</strong> - <code>/utag/account/profile/dev/utag.js</code></li>\n<li><strong>QA</strong> - <code>/utag/account/profile/qa/utag.js</code></li>\n<li><strong>Prod</strong> - <code>/utag/account/profile/prod/utag.js</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Custom environment names are case-sensitive in the URL for <code>utag.js</code>. For example, if you create a custom environment named <code>Preview</code>, the URL path to the <code>utag.js</code> file in that environment would be: <code>/utag/ACCOUNT/PROFILE/Preview/utag.js</code></p>\n<p>To test custom publish environments, you can use <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/tealium-tools/web-companion/\">Web Companion</a> or the <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/tealium-tools/environment-switcher/\">Environment Switcher Tealium Tool</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"enabling-custom-publish-environments\">Enabling custom publish environments</h2>\n<p>Before you can create a custom environment, you must enable the feature.</p>\n<p>To enable custom publish environments:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the admin menu, click <strong>Configure Publish Settings</strong>.

Users without permission to publish to Prod can submit a publish request to Prod for approval by users with permission to publish to Prod. If approved, the changes will go to Prod. Otherwise, no publish occurs. While a version is pending approval, only approvers will be able to save changes to it. For this reason, it is important for submitters to always perform a <strong>Save as</strong> when publishing to Prod.</p>\n<p>Familiarize yourself with the following terms and how they apply to Workflow Management when using this feature:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Disabled</strong><br>\nWhen Workflow Management is disabled (default setting), the Prod publish target is only available to users with permission to use it.</li>\n<li><strong>Enabled</strong><br>\nWhen Workflow Management is enabled, the Prod publish target becomes available to any user with either the Publish to Dev or Publish to QA permission.</li>\n<li><strong>Submitter</strong><br>\nUsers that submit requests to publish to Prod are called submitters. When a submitter submits a version to publish to Prod, it is sent to a queue of pending publishes where it must be reviewed before it will actually publish.</li>\n<li><strong>Approver</strong><br>\nUsers with the <strong>Publish to Prod</strong> permission are notified of the pending request and can approve or decline the submitted version.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"workflow\">Workflow</h3>\n<p>The workflow from submitter to approver is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A submitter performs a <strong>Save as</strong> and selects <strong>Publish To: Prod</strong>.<br>\nThe saved changes are not actually published to Prod, but instead are sent to a queue to await review.</li>\n<li>An email is sent to all approvers notifying them of the pending publish to Prod request.</li>\n<li>Any approver can log into the account/profile to review the pending publish and take one of two actions:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Approve</strong> – the changes are approved and the version is published to Prod.</li>\n<li><strong>Decline</strong> – the changes are denied and no publish occurs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"setting-up-workflow-management\">Setting Up workflow management</h2>\n<p>The following sections describe how to enable Workflow Management from the <strong>Publish Settings</strong> screen and then adjust user permissions by updating user permissions for your submitters and approvers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enable-workflow-management\">Enable workflow management</h3>\n<p>Use the following steps to enable Workflow Management for your profile:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>In the admin menu, click <strong>Configure Publish Settings</strong>. The <strong>Publish Configuration</strong> dialog appears.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the <strong>Version Workflow</strong> section, scroll down to <strong>Workflow Management</strong> and click <strong>On</strong>.<br>\n<figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/iq-tag-management/whiteui-tiq-publishworkflowmanagement-publish-configuration-dialog.png\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/iq-tag-management/whiteui-tiq-publishworkflowmanagement-publish-configuration-dialog.png\"\n             alt=\"Publish Workflow Management - Publish Configuration Dialog\"\n             title=\"Publish Workflow Management - Publish Configuration Dialog\"/>\n        </a>\n    </figure></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>. The <strong>Save/Publish</strong> dialog appears.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Save As</strong>.</p>\n <p class=\"note\"><i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-triangle\"></i>It is important for the approver that the submitter uses <strong>Save As</strong> versus <strong>Save</strong>.

The following sections describe how to adjust user permissions for each type of user.</p>\n<h3 id=\"submitter-permissions\">Submitter permissions</h3>\n<p>Submitters are users that cannot publish directly to Prod. Their changes must be approved through the workflow process. Submitters must have the <strong>Publish to Prod Environment</strong> permission removed. The <strong>Publish to QA Environment</strong> and <strong>Publish to Dev/Custom Environment</strong> settings should remain checked.</p>\n<p>Use the following steps to adjust user permissions for a submitter:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the admin menu, click <strong>Manage Users</strong>. The <strong>User Manager</strong> dialog appears.</li>\n<li>Click a checkbox to select an existing user or add a user, and then click <strong>Edit/View User Permissions</strong>.<br>\n<figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/iq-tag-management/whiteui-tiq-publishworkflowmanagement-clickeditviewuserpermissions.png\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/iq-tag-management/whiteui-tiq-publishworkflowmanagement-clickeditviewuserpermissions.png\"\n             alt=\"Click Edit - View User Permissions\"\n             title=\"Click Edit - View User Permissions\"/>\n        </a>\n    </figure><br>\nA new dialog appears.</li>\n<li>Select the <strong>Select Profiles</strong> radio button and leave the default value of the current profile in the profile list.<br>\n<figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/iq-tag-management/whiteui-tiq-editviewuserpermissions-selectprofiles-editprofilelist.png\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/iq-tag-management/whiteui-tiq-editviewuserpermissions-selectprofiles-editprofilelist.png\"\n             alt=\"Select Profiles - Edit Profile List\"\n             title=\"Select Profiles - Edit Profile List\"/>\n        </a>\n    </figure></li>\n<li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>\n<li>Ensure that <strong>Publish to Dev/Custom Environment</strong> and <strong>Publish to QA Environment</strong> remain checked.</li>\n<li>Uncheck <strong>Publish to Prod Environment</strong> and then click <strong>Next.</strong><br>\n<figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/iq-tag-management/whiteui-tiq-publishworkflowmanagement-editviewuerpermissions-uncheck-publish-to-prod.png\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/iq-tag-management/whiteui-tiq-publishworkflowmanagement-editviewuerpermissions-uncheck-publish-to-prod.png\"\n             alt=\"Uncheck Publish to Prod\"\n             title=\"Uncheck Publish to Prod\"/>\n        </a>\n    </figure></li>\n<li>Click <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Close</strong> to close the <strong>Edit/View User Permissions</strong> dialog.</li>\n<li>Save and Publish your changes.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"approver-permissions\">Approver permissions</h3>\n<p>Approvers are users that can publish directly to Prod, and they are responsible for reviewing pending publishes to Prod. Approvers must have the <strong>Publish to Prod Environment</strong> permission enabled. Due to the fact that all approvers receive email notifications each time a request for publish is submitted, it is best to limit the number of approvers in your profile.</p>\n<p>Use the following steps to adjust user permissions for an approver:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the admin menu, click <strong>Manage Users</strong>. The <strong>User Manager</strong> dialog appears.</li>\n<li>Click a checkbox to select an existing user or add a user, and then click <strong>Edit/View User Permissions</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select the <strong>Select Profiles</strong> radio button and leave the default value of the current profile in the profile list.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>\n<li>Check <strong>Publish to Prod Environment</strong> and then click <strong>Next.</strong></li>\n<li>Click <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Close</strong> to close the <strong>Edit/View User Permissions</strong> dialog.</li>\n<li>Save and Publish your changes.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"workflow-example\">Workflow example</h2>\n<p>Once you have enabled Workflow Management and set the publish permissions for your users, you are ready to see it in action.
