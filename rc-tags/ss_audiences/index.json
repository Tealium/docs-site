            "body":"<p>Tealium AudienceStream CDP Audiences provides a streamlined and powerful audience management experience with the following features:</p><ul><li>The ability to add an activation (connector) during audience creation.</li><li>The ability to save audience segments (groups of conditions) and reuse them in other audiences.</li><li>The ability to exclude segments of an audience.</li><li>Audience details view with the following tabs:<ul><li><strong>Insights</strong> tab – displays graphs of visitors and audience activity.</li><li><strong>Activations</strong> tab – lists activations for the audience. You can also add activations from this tab.</li><li><strong>Functions</strong> tabs – lists the functions that are triggered by the audience.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2><p>An audience is a group of visitors identified by a shared set of attributes. The conditions for an audience specify the attribute values for visitors in that audience. The more conditions you add, the more specific your audience becomes. Audiences are dynamic, meaning visitors can join or leave audiences as events come in from active visitor sessions.</p><h2 id=\"conditions-and-segments\">Conditions and segments</h2><p>An audience segment contains one or more conditions. You can save segments and use them in other audiences. Multiple conditions can be combined with AND or OR logic. You can use excluding logic to remove visitors that meet audience conditions.</p><h3 id=\"and-logic-example\">AND logic example</h3><p>A segment for an audience containing visitors who have spent over $1000 and have the Fan badge would have the following conditions:</p><figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/guides/server-side/int-aud-fan-spent-1000.png\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/guides/server-side/int-aud-fan-spent-1000.png\"/>    </a></figure><h3 id=\"or-logic-example\">OR logic example</h3><p>Additional visitors can be added to an audience by combining segments with OR logic. The following example combines two segments to create an audience that contains visitors with the <code>Fan</code> badge or visitors who have spent over $500. Visitors that match the conditions for either segment are included in the audience.</p><figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/guides/server-side/int-aud-fan-or-spent-500.png\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/guides/server-side/int-aud-fan-or-spent-500.png\"/>    </a></figure><h3 id=\"excluding-logic-example\">Excluding logic example</h3><p>To exclude specific visitors that meet the audience conditions, use excluding logic. For example, to create an audience of frequent visitors that have not visited in the last three days, you could use the following conditions: <figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/guides/server-side/int-aud-excluding-logic.png\"><img src=\"https://docs.tealium.com/images/guides/server-side/int-aud-excluding-logic.png\"/>    </a></figure></p><h2 id=\"visitor-retention-time\">Visitor retention time</h2><p>Visitor retention time refers to the length of time that AudienceStream retains visitor profiles after their last activity. Each incoming event associated with a visitor profile restarts the retention start time. If a visitor has been inactive for the length of the retention period, the profile is purged from the system.</p><p>Retention time is specified in two places:</p><ul><li><strong>Profile Retention Time</strong> in <a href=\"/server-side/administration/account-settings/\">Server-side account settings</a>, which is set for the account and cannot be modified.</li><li><strong>Audience Retention Time</strong> set for an audience. When <strong>Audience Retention Time</strong> is set for an audience, it overrides the profile retention time.</li></ul><p>The retention time applied to a visitor is determined by one of the following:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Longest audience retention time</strong><br>If the visitor is a member of any audience with a retention time specified, the longest retention time of the visitor&rsquo;s audiences is used (even if this is shorter than the profile retention time).</p></li><li><p><strong>Profile retention time</strong><br>If the visitor is not a member of any audiences with a retention time specified, then the profile retention time is used.</p></li></ul><p class=\"tip\"><i class=\"fa fa-info-circle\"></i>The maximum allowed profile and audience retention times are determined by your contract terms.</p><h3 id=\"example\">Example</h3><p>If your account has a profile retention time of 60 days, all visitor profiles with a last event activity timestamp older than 60 days are removed from AudienceStream. This means the entire visitor profile is deleted. If that same visitor were to return and trigger event activity, a new visitor profile would be created in AudienceStream.</p><p>To store visitor profiles longer than your account/profile retention period, the visitor must be added to an audience that has a longer retention time.</p><p>The following example illustrates how visitor retention time works with audiences that have times that are longer and shorter than the profile retention time.</p><ul><li><strong>Profile Retention Time</strong>: 60 days</li><li><strong>&ldquo;Window Shopper&rdquo; audience retention time</strong>: 30 days</li><li><strong>&ldquo;VIP Purchaser (&gt; $500)&rdquo; audience retention time</strong>: 90 days</li></ul><table><thead><tr><th>Action</th><th>Day</th><th>Days Inactive</th><th>&ldquo;Window Shopper&rdquo;</th><th>&ldquo;VIP Purchaser&rdquo;</th><th>AudienceStream</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Visits Website,<br> browses products</td><td>May 1st</td><td>0</td><td>✓ Added</td><td></td><td>✓ New profile</td></tr><tr><td>N/A</td><td>May 31st</td><td>30</td><td>✗ Removed</td><td></td><td>✗ Removed</td></tr><tr><td>Visits Website,<br> Purchases $550</td><td>Aug 1st</td><td>0</td><td></td><td>✓ Added</td><td>✓ New profile</td></tr><tr><td>N/A</td><td>Sep 30th</td><td>60</td><td></td><td>✓ Retained</td><td>✓ Retained</td></tr><tr><td>N/A</td><td>Oct 30th</td><td>90</td><td></td><td>✗ Removed</td><td>✗ Removed</td></tr></tbody></table>"
