If you are interested in trying this feature, contact your Tealium Support representative.</p><p>Integrated Audiences is a new version of Audiences that simplifies the process of creating audiences and includes the following features:</p><ul><li>The ability to add an activation (connector) during audience creation.</li><li>Saved segments, which allow you to save audience conditions and re-use them in other audiences.</li><li>Excluding logic for conditions.</li><li>Insights tab in the audience details view that displays graphs of visitors and audience activity.</li><li>Activations tab in the audience details view that lists activations for this audience. You can also add activations from this tab.</li><li>Functions tab in the audience details view that lists the functions that are triggered by this audience.</li></ul><h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2><p>An audience is a group of visitors identified by a shared set of attributes. The conditions for an audience specify the attribute values for visitors in that audience. The more conditions you add, the more specific your audience becomes. Audiences are dynamic, meaning visitors can join or leave audiences as events come in from active visitor sessions.</p><h3 id=\"audience-conditions-and-segments\">Audience conditions and segments</h3><p>An audience segment contains one or more conditions. You can save segments and use them in other audiences. Multiple conditions can be combined with AND or OR logic. You can use excluding logic to exclude visitors that meet audience conditions.</p><h4 id=\"and-logic-example\">AND logic example</h4><p>A segment for an audience containing visitors who have spent over $1000 and have the Fan badge would have the following conditions:</p><figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/guides/server-side/int-aud-fan-spent-1000.png\"><img src=\"/images/guides/server-side/int-aud-fan-spent-1000.png\"/>    </a></figure><h4 id=\"or-logic-example\">OR logic example</h4><p>Additional visitors can be added to an audience by combining segments with OR logic. The following example combines two segments to create an audience that contains visitors who have spent over $500 and visitors with the Frequent visitor badge. Visitors that match the conditions for either segment are included in the audience.</p><figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/guides/server-side/int-aud-fan-or-spent-500.png\"><img src=\"/images/guides/server-side/int-aud-fan-or-spent-500.png\"/>    </a></figure><h4 id=\"excluding-logic-example\">Excluding logic example</h4><p>To exclude specific visitors that meet the audience conditions, use excluding logic. For example, to create an audience of frequent visitors that have not visited in the last three days, you could use the following conditions: <figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"/images/guides/server-side/int-aud-excluding-logic.png\"><img src=\"/images/guides/server-side/int-aud-excluding-logic.png\"/>    </a></figure></p><h2 id=\"create-an-audience\">Create an Audience</h2><p>Use the following steps to create an audience:</p><ol><li>Navigate to <strong>AudienceStream &gt;
