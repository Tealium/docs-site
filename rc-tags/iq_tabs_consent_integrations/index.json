            "body":"<p>The new Consent Enforcement Framework is a core feature of Tealium iQ Consent Integrations that enables robust and reliable enforcement of consent signals captured outside of Tealium iQ Tag Management. This feature blocks tracking when customer consent is not given or is ambiguous.</p><p>Tealium iQ Consent Integrations provides the option for both opt-in (GDPR-style) and opt-out (CCPA-style) enforcement patterns for the supported consent management platforms (CMPs). Integrations can be written in the form of templates to support most CMPs or custom solutions.</p><p class=\"note\"><i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-triangle\"></i>Tealium iQ Consent Integrations has a dependency on the latest utag version 4.49. To enable support in previous versions, edit the <strong>uTag Loader</strong> template and add <code>##UTCM##</code> under the <code>##UTGEN##</code>publish engine flag.</p><p>The following terms are related to the consent integrations framework:</p><ul><li><strong>Purpose</strong> - A specific data use purpose to which your website users can consent (or withhold consent).</li><li><strong>Purpose Group</strong> - A list of purposes. A representation of an enforcement policy in the form of a group of consent purposes to which tags are assigned.</li><li><strong>Exemption</strong> - A case where no enforcement is necessary and no tags need to be blocked based on consent decisions. Enforcement exemptions differ from the behavior when no consent integration enforcement rules apply. Unless there&rsquo;s an explicit exemption, or matching consent integration and the appropriate consent decision, no tags are allowed to fire.</li><li><strong>Enforcement Rule</strong> - Rules that determine when to enforce a consent integration or exemption.</li><li><strong>Consent Decision</strong> - An array of purposes that have been consented to. Consent Decision is determined with a <code>type</code> attribute and is either <code>implicit</code> or <code>explicit</code>, depending on whether the user has made an active decision (<code>implicit</code>) or not (<code>explicit</code>).</li><li><strong>Implicit decision</strong> - A decision inferred from a user&rsquo;s behavior. By visiting a site, a user consents to the necessary tags as described in the site’s privacy policy. A user can object to the sale of their data, but by default this is enabled (there is an implicit &lsquo;it&rsquo;s OK, to share/sell my data&rsquo; decision).</li><li><strong>Explicit decision</strong> - A clear and precise consent decision by a user about what tracking they consent to.</li><li><strong>Integration</strong> A set of features and configurations (pre-loaded or custom) that capture a consent decision from a specified CMP. An integration is associated with a purpose group.</li></ul><h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2><p>Tealium iQ Consent Integrations enables you to integrate with supported non-Tealium consent management platforms. Your CMP prompts end-users for purpose-based consent as needed, and then captures and stores those user consent decisions. When an integration is active, tags must be assigned to purposes within a purpose group before they can be triggered. A purpose must be consented to before tags assigned to that purpose can be triggered.</p><p>Each consent integration instructs the underlying framework how to communicate with a single CMP. Only one integration may be active simultaneously. However, you can use <strong>Enforcement Rules</strong> to conditionally apply multiple active integrations without conflict, if needed.</p><p class=\"note\"><i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-triangle\"></i>Note that tags that inject CMPs into the page are not compatible with Tealium iQ Consent Integration. Integrations require a signal from the CMP before tags are loaded. To integrate your CMP with Consent Integrations, use a Preloader or DOM Ready extension, or add the CMP to the page outside of Tealium iQ.</p><p>You can set up an integration with a supported CMP in the Tealium iQ dashboard, or create a custom integration by editing the <strong>Custom template</strong>.</p><h2 id=\"supported-integrations\">Supported integrations</h2><p>See <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/consent-integrations/supported-vendors/\">Supported Vendor Integrations</a> for a full list of currently supported integrations.</p><h2 id=\"manage-integrations\">Manage integrations</h2><p>In the Tealium iQ dashboard, the Consent Integrations screen provides the ability to add and configure consent integrations.</p><h3 id=\"add-an-integration\">Add an integration</h3><p>Follow the steps below to add an integration:</p><ol><li>Go to <strong>iQ Tag Management &gt; Consent Integrations.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>+ Add Integration</strong> to open the integration configuration modals.</li></ol><h4 id=\"step-1-configure-integrations\">Step 1: Configure integrations</h4><ol><li>In the <strong>Configure Integrations</strong> tab, enter a descriptive name for your integration.</li><li>Select a vendor from the <strong>Vendor</strong> list.

Note that no tags are triggered if the mapped purposes are not consented to.</p><p>Most tags don&rsquo;t need to be triggered again if they have consent in each of these cases. Triggering tags again may result in double tracking in some cases, which should be avoided.</p><p>Customer Data Hub customers (especially EventStream customers) can benefit from refiring the Collect tag and using the <code>purposes_with_consent_unprocessed</code>  attribute for the server-side activation logic to ensure that no server-side activation is refired for the same event. Using the <code>purposes_with_consent_unprocessed</code> attribute allows server-side activations to be triggered as quickly as possible without triggering twice for the same event.</p><h2 id=\"access-the-consent-decision-within-tealium-iq\">Access the consent decision within Tealium iQ</h2><p>​Consent decisions (<code>ConsentDecision</code>) are provided in the <code>b object</code> for each event in the following attributes, which can be used in tags and are automatically sent by the <a href=\"/client-side-tags/tealium-collect-tag/\">Collect tag</a>, but are not available for extensions.</p><ul><li><code>tci.consent_type</code>  - The ConsentDecision&rsquo;s <code>type</code> attribute ( <code>implicit</code> or <code>explicit</code> ).</li><li><code>tci.purposes_with_consent_all</code>  - The full <code>ConsentDecision</code> array, all permitted purposes.</li><li><code>tci.purposes_with_consent_processed</code> - The array of processed consented purposes.</li><li><code>tci.purposes_with_consent_unprocessed</code> - The array of unprocessed consented purposes.</li></ul><h3 id=\"access-the-consent-decision-from-extensions\">Access the consent decision from extensions</h3><p><code>tealiumCmpIntegration.GetCurrentConsentDecision()</code> returns the current consent decision and can be used to access consent decisions from extensions.</p><p>The following command adds the current consent decision to the <code>b object</code> for all subsequent extensions and passes it to tags along with the <code>tci.*</code> attributes:</p><div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">b</span>.<span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">currentConsentDecision</span> <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">tealiumCmpIntegration</span>.<span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">getCurrentConsentDecision</span>()</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id=\"using-the-javascript-console\">Using the JavaScript console</h2><p>When active, you can interact with a consent integration in the JavaScript console on pages where utag.js (Tealium iQ) is implemented. Using the JavaScript console allows you to get the current consent decision that is retrieved from the CMP on every event. The consent decision is never cached by Tealium to ensure it is always up to date.</p><p>For more details, see the related <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/consent-integrations/validate-and-debug/\">debugging documentation</a>.</p><h2 id=\"server-side-attributes---using-collect-with-consent-integrations\">Server-side attributes - using Collect with Consent Integrations</h2><p>Tealium Collect, like all other tags, must be mapped to a consented purpose. However, the <code>refiringAllowed</code> option allows tags to be refired on new decisions. This process indicates that the tag is being used for a variety of server-side purposes, and available server-side filters and logic are used to ensure that the signal is only processed appropriately while allowing it to refire.</p><p>Depending on which server-side tools you use, the Collect tag is triggered with the following event-level attributes for each event:</p><ul><li><code>tci.purposes_with_consent_unprocessed</code> (with refiring)</li><li><code>tci.purposes_with_consent_all</code> (without refiring)</li></ul><h3 id=\"opt-in-model\">Opt-in model</h3><figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaquith/cmp-integrations/main/docs-src/static/tiq-cmp-integration-flow-opt-in.png\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaquith/cmp-integrations/main/docs-src/static/tiq-cmp-integration-flow-opt-in.png\"/>    </a></figure><p>Tealium iQ will not fire tags or set cookies until a consent decision is received from the CMP. If the expected CMP is not active on the page or Tealium iQ has not been consented, Tealium iQ will not run and no tags will be fired.</p><p>If no consent decision is found when Tealium iQ loads, Tealium iQ consent integration polls until one is found.</p><p>Until a consent decision is received from the CMP, all events are queued to be processed once a decision is found. If no consent decision is received, no events are processed.</p><p>If a consent decision ( <code>implicit</code> or <code>explicit</code> ) is available from the CMP, the following takes place:</p><ul><li>Tealium iQ consent integration first checks if Tealium iQ is allowed to run (since it sets cookies).</li><li>If Tealium iQ is allowed to run, it checks if each tag can run</li><li>If the tags can run, it then triggers the tags according to consent for all queued events.</li></ul><p>If the consent decision is implicit, the events go into a different queue after implicitly consented tags are fired so that they can be reprocessed for newly consented tags when the user makes an explicit decision. The solution searches for an explicit decision until one is found.</p><p>If the consent decision is explicit, all queues are emptied and polling stops. Tags fired on an implicit consent are not re-fired when the explicit consent decision is processed unless tag refire is enabled and there are new consent purposes to process.</p><p>When a user reopens the interactive CMP layer and makes a new explicit consent decision, previous events are not reprocessed with the new consent decision.</p><p>For new events processed after Tealium iQ is first loaded, the new consent decision is retrieved from the CMP as each event is processed by Tealium iQ to ensure that the CMP is treated as a universal source of truth.</p><h3 id=\"opt-out-model\">Opt-out model</h3><figure><a class=\"slb\" href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaquith/cmp-integrations/main/docs-src/static/tiq-cmp-integration-flow-opt-out.png\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaquith/cmp-integrations/main/docs-src/static/tiq-cmp-integration-flow-opt-out.png\"/>    </a></figure><p>The opt-out model is similar to the Opt-in model, but explicit decision is not polled as it is more restrictive than the default setting (CCPA/CPRA style) in the Opt-out model.</p>"

These integration templates are designed to be as lightweight as possible.</li></ul><p>Our <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/consent-integrations/supported-vendors/\">pre-built integrations</a> supports integration with various consent management platforms (CMPs). However, there are instances where a custom integration is recommended, such as:</p><ul><li>Using a CMP without a pre-built integration.</li><li>Using an internal tool to capture consent.</li><li>Using a supported CMP with extensive customizations that break the standard integration.</li></ul><p>In such cases, you can use a custom integration. By using JavaScript functions, any consent capture tool can leverage the enforcement framework.</p><p>To add a new custom integration, use the existing integrations and the provided template as a guide.</p><p>The following describes a basic workflow for creating a custom integration:</p><ol><li>Develop and debug the integration outside Tealium iQ (website where CMP is implemented).</li><li>In Tealium iQ, add a new custom consent integration and purpose group. For more information, see <a href=\"/iq-tag-management/consent-integrations/about/\">About Consent Integrations</a>.</li><li>Assign Tealium iQ and the appropriate tags to the purposes within the purpose group.</li><li>To create the template, save your profile.</li><li><a href=\"/iq-tag-management/templates/manage/\">Edit the newly created template</a>.</li><li>Publish the template to a development or test environment to verify that everything works as expected, and then follow your normal testing and publishing flow.</li></ol><h2 id=\"develop-debug-and-validate-custom-integrations\">Develop, debug, and validate custom integrations</h2><p>To create your custom CMP integration, edit the <a href=\"#custom-integration-template\">custom template</a> below to meet your CMP requirements.
